            "content": "Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics.

            "content": "Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices.

This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters \"ABC-1234\" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.",

            "content": "Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2.

Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.",

But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done.

You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.",

Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use. Get a Knox Suite license The first step towards getting a Knox Suite license is signing up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't already done so. Refer to our detailed walkthrough of the account set up process for more information. Once you have an account, do the following: 1. Apply for access to Knox Suite. Refer to Apply for access to Knox Suite to learn more. 2. Once you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, navigate to the Licenses page to generate your Knox Capture license. Refer to the Manage other licenses section of the Knox Admin Portal's how-to guide for a detailed walkthrough. 3. Once you generate your Knox Suite license, use the key to activate your Knox Capture license. Activate your Knox Capture license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: For IT admins using Knox Capture, the license can be activated through the License menu in the app. To allow end-users to fully use Knox Capture app in managed mode, the license must be activated through your EMM. #Through the License menu There are two options for activating a license through the License menu. ##Option 1: Enter license key manually 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting for your Knox Capture license key. After you enter the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. ##Option 2: Enter license by scanning a QR code To use this method, you'll first need to have a valid Knox Suite license key converted into QR code format. Once you have a QR code generated: 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the QR code button. A scanning window appears. 3. Aim the camera at the QR code, then tap Done to activate the license. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. #Through your EMM To activate a license through your EMM: 1. Open the application configuration dialog for Knox Capture in the EMM console. In a typical EMM console, the app configuration (or App Config) screen opens as a pop-up window or modal. 2. Paste the key within the license field 3. Save the configuration. View remaining scans If you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat. #By uninstalling the Knox Capture app To manually deactivate the license seat for a device, simply uninstall the Knox Capture app. The license agent then releases the associated seat for usage.",

            "content": "Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId \"com.test.smartscan\" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=\"intent_in_testmode\" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= \"com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list\" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = \"com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data\" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = \"com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data\" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = \"com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type\" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = \"com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source\" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = \"com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type\" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = \"camera\" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \\n\") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let \") } sb.append(\"]\") } sb.append(\"}\") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity. Intent action - `intent.action.activity`, Intent category - `intent.category.DEFAULT`, Intent delivery - `Send via startActivity`, Component information - `test.smartscan` For Knox Capture admins To set up intent output: 1. On the Knox Capture home screen, tap on the profile you want to set intent output for. 2. Under Intent output, tap Select app packages. 3. Select the apps for intent output, then tap < in the top left to return to the previous screen. Make sure the package name matches your business app. 4. Under Intent output, specify an Intent action, Intent category, and Intent delivery method to handle the intent. Intent action and category - The intent filter information matching the business app's intent filter information. For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data. Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.",

When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.",

            "content": "AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time.

You'll be taken to the AR overlay field selection screen. See Customize AR overlay information to learn more. Customize AR overlay information After you connect Knox Capture AR to a product database server, the AR overlay can display important product information on-screen whenever a barcode is scanned. This information is presented in a pop-up above the barcode, and contains the following: Title - This is the main text that appears in the pop-up whenever a barcode is scanned. Image - This image appears as a thumbnail in the pop-up, and as a larger image in the product details whenever the user taps the > button. Fields - This information appears in the the product details after the user taps the > button. To configure the AR overlay information: 1. On the AR templates screen, find the template that you want to customize and tap the menu button (three vertical dots), then tap Edit. 2. In Title, select the data that you want to display as the main title in the pop-up. 3. In Image, select how you want the image to appear - whether a thumbnail or full size image - when the user expands the Product details. Note that this step affects the image in the product details. The thumbnail image always appears in the pop-up, regardless of the size you select. 4. In Fields, select the information that appears when the user the > button to expand the product details in the pop-up. For View-and-update AR templates, admins can specify which fields can be updated by the user by tapping the edit icon (pencil) next to a field name. The edit icon turns blue to indicate fields that can be overwritten. Note that fields only display the edit icon if they were given WRITE permissions in the database. 5. Tap Done to save the settings. Connecting AR to a database server For customers who want to display important product details in the AR overlay every time a barcode is scanned, a connection between Knox Capture and the database server must first be set up. Enterprise organizations are responsible for setting up their own database servers, either through their own IT departments, or from a third-party vendor of their choosing. This section mainly provides guidelines for setting up the database server, focusing primarily on the REST APIs required for server setup. #REST API guidelines ##URI: `/login` , Description: This API is used to check user/client credential requirements.

Get Knox Capture: Scandit Edition trial license If you're using Knox Capture: Scandit Edition, you need to sign in to the Knox Admin Portal in order to generate a trial license. If you don't already have access to the Knox Admin Portal, refer to the Sign up for Knox account page. Once you're in the Knox Admin Portal: 1. Go to Licenses > OTHER KNOX LICENSES > Manage license keys. 2. On the Other license keys page, click Actions > Generate Knox Capture Scandit Edition trial license key. 3. Use the LICENSE NUMBER to activate your Knox Capture trial on the device or through your EMM. Activate your license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: Through your EMM, Through the License menu #Through your EMM To activate a license through your EMM: 1. Open the application configuration dialog for in the EMM console. In a typical EMM console, the app configuration (or App Config) screen opens as a pop-up window or modal. 2. Paste the key within the license field. Optionally include the scanning configuration as well. Refer to Deployment for more information. 3. Save the configuration. #Through the License menu The License menu only appears in Admin mode. To activate a license through the License menu: 1. On the home screen, tap the more actions icon, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting you to enter your Knox Capture license key. After you've entered the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. View remaining scans From Knox Capture v1.6 onwards, if you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can now view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat. #By uninstalling the Knox Capture app To manually deactivate the license seat for a device, simply uninstall the Knox Capture app. The license agent then releases the associated seat for usage.",

Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner. Scans from hardware devices count towards the 100 free scan limit, and a Knox Capture license must be activated to continue using the hardware scanning functionality past this limit.

New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the \"Android - Secured by Knox\" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type.

New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes",

New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information.

            "content": "Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.",

If your devices are enrolled as company-owned devices with work profiles, ensure that the Knox Service Plugin version in your EMM is 1.2.74 or higher before following the instructions below. Overview On Verizon XCover Pro devices, the XCover key is mapped to Verizon PTT (Push to Talk). This mapping prevents the device from triggering a camera scan when the user presses that key. How do I set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a Verizon XCover Pro device? There are two ways to override the Verizon PTT mapping: Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping, Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a single device before installing Knox Capture This procedure describes how to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a Verizon XCover Pro device. Perform this procedure before installing Knox Capture on the device. This procedure is useful if you're still in the process of testing Knox Capture on a device. If your goal is to configure a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices, see Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices instead. This procedure assumes that you haven't installed Knox Capture on the device. 1. On the device, tap Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key and switch off Verizon PTT. 2. Install Knox Capture. During installation, Knox Capture trigger is automatically assigned to the XCover key's Press action. You can verify this by going to Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key. Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices This procedure describes how to use your EMM to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on Verizon XCover Pro devices and program the XCover key to trigger a camera scan. In this procedure, Knox Manage is used to illustrate the steps, but the steps are similar for other EMMs. This procedure assumes you've set up the Knox Service Plugin app with your EMM and that Knox Capture is installed on the devices. 1. On your EMM console, open the Knox Service Plugin policies. To do this on the Knox Manage console, add or modify an Android Enterprise profile. Then, in the Samsung Knox policies, click Knox Service Plugin. For information on how to open the Knox Service Plugin policies on a different EMM, refer to that EMM's documentation. 2. Under Device-wide policies, set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Device Key Mapping (Premium), configure the mapping: 1. Set Enable Key Mapping Controls to True. 2. Set Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams to False. 3. For Package Name, enter com.samsung.android.app.smartscan. 4. For Intent for Key press, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS. 5. For Intent for Key release, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE. 6. Set Enable Key Mapping to Launch & Exit applications to False. 4. Save and assign the configured profile to the Verizon XCover Pro devices. 5. Verify that the configuration was applied successfully: 1. On one of the devices, launch the KSP app and tap Apply policies. 2. Go to Settings > Advanced features and verify that the XCover Key is disabled (grayed out). Pressing the XCover key now triggers a camera scan.",

Android 11, Chromium-based browsers, including: Samsung Internet , Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge Resolution If you are experiencing this issue, there are two resolutions and one workaround for scanning barcode data into HTML fields: Using the Advanced data formatting method, Using the Floating Action Button (FAB) method, Using another web browser as a workaround #Advanced data formatting method This method has been tested and confirmed working on the following device models running Android 11 with Knox Capture 1.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1. Refer to the procedure for Advanced data formatting and follow steps 1 - 6. After you tap Add Actions, a list of options opens. 2. Select Send Pause and tap Add. 3. Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5.

Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay.

Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow.

Code \"12345678\" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code \"123456\" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code \"12345\" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code \"1234\" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code.

            "content": "Active Knox Suite license fails to activate all Knox Suite services. You may experience an issue where an active Knox Suite license doesn't activate all Knox Suite services despite its key showing on the consolidated Licenses page. For example, the Knox Admin Portal might show that you have an active Knox Suite license for Knox Manage when you click License or Knox E-FOTA > License. However, it could be the case that the license didn't actually activate Knox E-FOTA. Cause An active Knox Suite license is only registered for all Knox Suite services when it has been assigned to each of the individual services in the Knox Suite bundle. Resolution The permissions needed to assign licenses to products depends on the admin's role and permissions. Ensure that the below resolution is performed by a Super Admin or a secondary admin with the appropriate permissions. To assign an active Knox Suite license key to other services in the Knox Suite bundle, register its key to any services that haven't been assigned it: 1. On the Knox Admin Portal, go to Licenses. The consolidated Licenses page opens. 2. Click ACTIONS > Enter license key, then enter a License name and License key in the respective fields. Since you're assigning a license key that's already in use, make sure not to use a duplicate license name. By assigning the active Knox Suite license on the consolidated licenses page, you re-register the key to each respective Knox Suite services.",

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it. Purchase Knox commercial licenses from your local reseller. Server-based licenses Server-based licenses include both cloud and on-premises services. Enter cloud license keys on the Knox Admin Portal, and enter on-premises license keys directly on the service console.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

Depending on the service, you can manage your licenses from different locations throughout the Knox Admin Portal, individual services, and your EMM console. If your Knox Platform for Enterprise license is about to expire within the next 90 days, make sure to renew the license for another two years. Otherwise, your existing devices will be impacted.

As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account. Additionally, make sure your Knox account is registered as your organization's primary administrator, also known as a super admin. To learn more about super admins, see: Manage admins and roles in Knox Configure. Invite and manage admins in Knox Mobile Enrollment. Manage roles in Knox E-FOTA. Add an administrator in Knox Manage.

            "content": "Feature Summary. For those wanting a quick reference to the security, manageability, and advanced VPN\"features offered by Samsung Knox devices, review the summary below. For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "title": "DualDAR Encryption",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

            "content": "Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "title": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps. Disable USB-connected updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from booting into Download Mode and installing a manual software update.

With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain. Per-app and device-wide modes - Give specific apps - for example, ones that handle confidential data - stronger firewalls, and all other apps on a device a more lenient firewall configuration.

The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

Not only can IT admins have real-time access to what the remote device screen is displaying, but also control it by injecting actions such as finger, keyboard, and mouse events. Although other mobile platforms also offer remote viewing of remote device displays, only Knox provides built-in remote control of devices without requiring third-party solutions. Here is an example use case: An enterprise employee is on a business trip. On encountering a problem with the company-issued mobile phone, the employee contacts an enterprise IT\"admin. The IT\"admin uses an EMM console to remotely view the device screen to observe the issue first hand, then remotely controls the device, through finger, mouse, or keyboard actions. The IT\"admin directly accesses the environment to remotely debug the issue on the device.\"The employee is now quickly productive, without the frustrating downtime associated with relaying instructions verbally or through email. The continuous polling of the device screens doesn't impact device performance as devices send only screen changes. Unique advantages of Knox Remote Control The Knox Platform provides built-in remote control without requiring third-party solutions. For enterprises, this control: Saves time by enabling IT admins to troubleshoot remote mobile device issues in real-time. Reduces employee down-time and optimizes employee productivity through quick problem resolution. Enables monitoring of devices for corporate policy violations along with corrective actions on the devices.",

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details.

The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account.

Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin.

In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service.

            "content": "Knox Admin Portal 21.09 release notes. Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

For example, this November 17, 2021 release - what would have been Knox cloud service 1.41 - uses 21.11 as the version name. End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Support for Samsung account login using Google SSO In this release, IT admins accessing the Knox Admin Portal through the direct console link can now sign in to their Samsung account using Google SSO. On the Samsung Account sign-in page, a Continue with Google button is available at the bottom of the screen. An IT admin can click this button to log in with their Google credentials and access the Knox Admin Portal. Okta SSO integration With 21.11, IT admins can set up Okta SSO to log in to SamsungKnox.com and the Knox Admin Portal. The three available SSO options are as follows: 1. Okta 2. Microsoft Azure AD 3. Ping Identity Please note that once Okta SSO is set up for a Knox cloud services tenant, its users can no longer log in to Knox services with their Samsung account credentials. See Configure Okta SSO settings for integration steps. Refreshed navigation sidebar The Knox Admin Portal navigation sidebar was refreshed for Knox cloud service 21.11. The color contrast between menu levels was increased, and a branding icon was added next to the name of each solution. Back to release notes",

This major Knox Admin Portal release includes several new features, such as global device search and the ability to manage administrators and roles across all Knox cloud services. Device search across services To help IT admins track devices across multiple Knox cloud solutions, this 22.03 release adds a global device search feature. Managed service provider customers can also use this feature to view device info for a specific company. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, enter a device IMEI/MEID or serial number to display all services the device is enrolled in, as well as its service-specific info. For example, if you search for a device that's enrolled in Knox Manage, info about its associated user ID, organization, and/or group shows under DEVICE INFORMATION. Consolidated administrators and roles menu Previously, IT admins managed admins and their roles separately for each Knox cloud service. Now, the consolidated administrators page offers a single interface for select admins to manage secondary admins. Through it, admins from any Knox cloud service who have invite permissions can invite and manage secondary admins. This new screen supports all existing admin functionality, but provides an at-a-glance view of all services that each admin has been invited to. Admins can access this view from Administrators & Roles in the left navigation bar.

Knox Remote Support allows IT admins to remotely connect to any user's device to help troubleshoot and even fix an issue. In this release, the Knox Remote Support feature is available in the Knox Admin Portal to all enterprise customers with a valid trial or commercial Knox Suite license. This feature involves two components - a Knox Remote Support agent installed on the device from the Google Play Store, and a web viewer that allows you to assist device users. See Knox Remote Support Viewer to learn more. Consolidated license menu This 22.05 release combines the menus for the following Knox products - Knox Suite, Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Configure, and Samsung Care+ for Business - into a single, consolidated license page on the Knox Admin Portal. This consolidated page is accessible from License in each service console and from the Licenses entry above Administrators & Roles in the Knox Admin Portal navigation pane. You can add, manage and delete your Knox cloud service license keys on this page. For example, instead of entering your Knox Suite license individually for each solution, you can enter it once and apply it to all your Knox Suite services.

To quickly access the Knox Admin Portal, click Customer portal > Knox Admin Portal on the Knox Guard console.

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

Using KDA, some administrators have reported that they are not able to enroll devices in more than one KCS. When adding a device in a second service (e.g. enrolling in Knox Mobile Enrollment after enrolling in Knox Configure), the following error message is shown: > The device is already enrolled. Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process. The NFC enrollment method will be deprecated from Android 11 onwards. Resolution Currently, KDA is only designed for use with one KCS service at a time.\"To avoid encountering issues with Bluetooth and NFC enrollment, please ensure you remove your device from any KCS services it is in before enrolling in another. If you would like to use both KME and KC, ask your reseller to upload your devices to your KME console. If you do not have a reseller, raise a support ticket through the Knox Admin Portal and our KCS team can assist. Additional information , To learn more about KDA, see the KME admin guide.

Although the support for the oldest version is no longer available on every first major release in the year, Knox solutions are supported on the latest five major Android versions. With this change, we commit to: 1. Maintain the best-in-class product quality by focusing our resources on the versions that majority of you use. 2. Enhance the security of Knox products by restricting the supported versions to recent ones that have valid security patches from OS or hardware. Exceptions , Knox Platform for Enterprise is supported from Knox 2.4 and each feature is dependent on the specific Knox version. Knox Manage is supported from seven major Android versions (6-12) as of March 2022. To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted. You may continue to use Knox products on such devices, but the Samsung teams won't provide support for issues on those devices.
