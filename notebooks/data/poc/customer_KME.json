Knox Mobile Enrollment is a service under the umbrella of the Knox Suite bundle of products. It provides seamless, reliable setup and enrollment of corporate-owned devices in EMMs. For active Knox Suite license holders, Knox Mobile Enrollment introduces advanced profiles, an enhanced type of profile that complements regular profiles and ensures secure deployment by providing you more controls for locking devices in unexpected scenarios. More specifically, advanced profiles let you: Automatically lock a device to ensure that device users can't bypass provisioning and registration. Remotely lock a device to prevent information security leaks in the event of device loss or theft. Immediately lock a device if it becomes rooted or starts running unofficial firmware. Easily lock or unlock one or more devices in one swift action and monitor their lock statuses. Unlock a device in secure offline environments using a one-time PIN. Key features Feature name Description Lock unenrolled devices Automatically locks the device if it isn't enrolled in an EMM by a specified date. Anytime remote lock/unlock Manually lock the device in scenarios when it's lost or stolen. Advanced device information For devices that are assigned advanced profiles, the Advanced tab allows locking and unlocking these devices in one swift action, and PIN-based device unlocking. It also provides more detailed information such as the profile statuses and device lock statuses. Prerequisites To use advanced profiles, you need: A Samsung account and a Samsung Knox account. For more information, see Create your Samsung accounts. Uploaded Samsung devices running Android 9 or higher. A valid Knox Suite license. An EMM that supports Knox Mobile Enrollment.

Resolve conflicts with Knox Guard If you have devices enrolled in Knox Guard, you can't use the functionality of Knox Mobile Enrollment advanced profiles on these devices. To avoid locking conflicts, a device that is enrolled in Knox Guard can't use advanced profile features. Therefore, prior to assigning an advanced profile to a device, you must first unenroll it from Knox Guard. Restrictions related to assigning advanced profiles for Knox Guard customers span both assignment scenarios: Assigning to a single device - The profile assignment fails, and the following notification on the Devices page confirms the failure and informs you that you need to unenroll the device from Knox Guard. Assigning to multiple devices - The profile assignment fails, and the following notification on the Devices page allows you to download the reason for the failures in a CSV file.",

For an overview of role-based access control and how it impacts an administrator invitation, go to: Role-based access control. Invite and manage admins Only selected and approved IT admins can enroll devices on behalf of customers. Invite IT admins from within the Knox Mobile Enrollment portal as needed, and assign them unique enrollment services and permissions. When an admin supporting multiple services applies to KME, they must be approved by an existing KME Samsung Admin, regardless of other existing services the applicant admin may already support. 1. Select Administrator & Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. Ensure the ADMINISTRATORS tab is selected. 2. Select INVITE ADMINISTRATOR from the upper, right-hand side of the screen. A different Invite administrator screen could display stating that before an administrator can be invited a role must be first created and available for assignment. Ensure appropriate roles and permissions are created and available before proceeding with an administrator invitation. If a role is required, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, proceed to step 4. 3. If a role is required to complete an administrator invitation, select the ROLES tab from the top of the Administrators & Roles screen, then select the CREATE ROLE button. Most permission categories within the Create role screen have a View only option that only permit an admin with this role to view items with no configuration, device or reseller administration permitted. New roles have the view only permission enabled by default. Existing roles that inherit a View only permission have it turned off by default, to prevent issues. If creating a role for a pending administrator invitation, provide the required Role name and an optional Description. Refer to the Permissions portion of the screen and enable then select additional permissions by category as required beyond the basic permissions assigned by default. The Invite and manage administrators permission can only be assigned by an administrator that themselves has that specific permission enabled. A Super Admin or an Admin with Admins' permissions can invite an admin belonging to a different service to a role in their service. Select the SAVE button to continue. If the user does not have the Assign with profile and manage tags permission enabled, all MDM profile options, except for Clear profile, will be disabled within the Configure devices pop (available from the ACTIONS drop-down menu within the Devices > UPLOADS screen). Enable Allow access to Knox Deployment Application to use the Knox Deployment App (KDA) exclusively for device enrollment into KME, without the use of the KME console. When relying on the KDA without the KME console an admin must login to the KDA, choose a service (KME, KC, KG, etc.), select a profile, pair the primary/admin device with a target device, and assign the profile to the target device. For more information on using the KDA, go to: Knox Deployment App (KDA). 4. Provide the following to complete an administrator invitation: First name - Provide the first name of the administrator resource. Last name - Provide the last name of the administrator resource. Email - If this email is not already associated with a Samsung Account, the user will have to create a Samsung Account before logging into Knox Mobile Enrollment. The creation of a Samsung account is required before an administrative account can be created. Samsung Knox does not support personal email addresses for _new_ Knox account requests that have not been registered as a Samsung account. If the administrator's email is already associated with an active samsungknox.com account, the invitation will fail with an error. Contact Knox Support for assistance in resolving the error. Role - Use the drop-down menu to assign this new administrator a role appropriate to their intended administrative function. If unsure about the exact permissions of an available role, select View Role Details to review the scope of its available permissions. The Role drop-down menu is customized for role assignments based on the administrator creating the invite. Roles cannot be deleted when there is at least one administrator using the role. An administrator must be assigned a different role to ensure no existing admins using the role before it can be deleted. Roles in a pending, revoked or blocked state can be optionally deleted by selecting the ROLE\"NAME within the Administrators & Roles screen. To delete the role, navigate to the bottom of the Edit role screen and select the DELETE button. However, a role cannot be deleted if there are still active users assigned to the role. A Delete role screen displays when a role re-assignment is required for a deletion. Select the VIEW\"ADMINISTRATOR button and return to the ROLES tab to review the administrators currently assigned this role. Administrators must be assigned to a different role to permit the role deletion. Existing administrators without a Create and manage roles permission can only invite admins with a matching set of their own permissions. 5. Select the INVITE button when completed. The newly added, but pending, administrator displays as a link that can be selected to edit the administrator name and role designation. If editing the administrator's profile, select the SAVE button to commit the additional updates. KME admins do not always want to see blocked or revoked admins within the Administrators & Roles screen.

You may wish to periodically download all their uploaded devices for archive. This can be done as a single action, and include devices from various resellers. The CSV file download contains device uploads in various pre-approved states, but no NFC devices. 1. Go to the UPLOADS tab. The UPLOADS tab displays each listed device's reseller, upload date, number of devices uploaded, upload approval status, and details. Click the View link under the DETAILS column to list the individual devices uploaded by the selected reseller. These listed devices can be configured as required for approval. For more information, see the Device configuration section. Additionally, the Configure devices option is removed from the UPLOADS tab if the Assign with profile and manage tags permission is not enabled in Administrators & Roles. Pending devices can be searched for and displayed by entering the device's 14- or 15-digit IMEI in the Search field. Searching opens a page with results, with device information listed in black and a device status of pending. You can download the search result as a CSV file or repeat the search function using the IMEI of other target pending devices. 2. Click DOWNLOAD DEVICES AS CSV to save the listed devices and their information as a CSV file. If the selection is greater than the 10,000 device limit, the file is emailed to you. The downloaded CSV contains important data that can be re-used if a device requires re-enrollment, including a device's IMEI (numeric device identifier), serial number, order number, order date, model, user ID, tags, submitted date, profile, status, reseller ID, reseller name, last modified admin, and last modified time. Delete a single device Devices can be deleted from KME by either selecting them on the DEVICES tab or by uploading a list of device IMEI/MEIDs. Once you have removed a device, it is permanently removed from the system. To re-upload the device to KME, your reseller must upload the device again, or you can use the Knox Deployment app (available from the Google Play Store). Any device removed from KME is also removed from the Knox Resellers Portal and Knox Configure (if applicable), so ensure you delete the correct devices. 1. Go to Devices, then click the DEVICES tab.

            "content": "Create profiles. Add new profiles, edit existing profiles and delete obsolete profiles as required as devices enroll in KME or require update. Before you can enroll devices into KME, you need to create a profile or edit an existing profile to meet your specific device enrollment requirements. There are no limits to the number of profiles that can be created and made available for assignment. When creating a profile within the KME console, the following special characters are not permitted (# / $ * % ^ & \\ ( ) + ? \"[ ] ). To create a profile: 1. Go to Profiles. 2. Select CREATE PROFILE, then select the type of profile you would like to create: _ANDROID ENTERPRISE_ - Select this profile to choose which out-of-box Android Enterprise enrollment method to use. When selected, the profile manages devices as fully managed devices. For more information, go to the Configure an Android Enterprise profile section. _ANDROID ENTERPRISE (ADVANCED)_ - Select this profile to leverage the additional features of advanced profiles. For legacy devices running Android 10 or lower, you can create Android Legacy (Device Admin) profiles. This profile allows you to skip the device setup flow and allow the device user to cancel enrollment. Determine the profile type best suited to your deployment needs and refer to one of the following pages: Configure an Android Enterprise profile , Configure an Android Enterprise (Advanced) profile , Configure a device admin profile Configure an Android Enterprise profile To configure a KME profile supported by Android Enterprise: When using a KME profile that supports fully managed devices or work profile on company-owned devices with Knox Configure (KC), the KC ProKiosk mode is not supported. 1. Select ANDROID ENTERPRISE on the Select profile type page. 2. Set the following BASIC INFORMATION for the profile: _Profile Name_ - Enter an appropriate profile name to distinguish it from others with similar attributes. _Description_ - Optionally provide a 200 character maximum description to further differentiate this profile from others. 3. Set the following EMM INFORMATION for the profile: Pick your EMM - Select the specific EMM assigned the device owner privilege. Support for fully managed Android devices is available for the following EMMs: Workspace ONE UEM Blackberry UEM Ivanti MobileIron Cloud Wizzy EMM Esper MDM IBM MaaS360 SOTI MobiControl Citrix Endpoint Management Ars Nova Systems TinyMDM ManageEngine Endpoint Central Sophos Mobile DeviceMax MDM Microsoft Intune DuoSTATION MDM Snow Software Snow Device Manage ProMDM Enterprise Mobility Samsung Knox Manage Vanguard Vostra Pulsus MDM Mobiltec Cloud4Mobile Mitsogo Hexnode MDM AppTec360 EMM Wenable WeGuard Crypto VoIP MDM If Other is selected, the APK field remains editable for manually entering the path to the APK. For information on supported EMM partners and how to access their own partner support documentation directly from their web pages, see Android Enterprise device owner. EMMs with APKs available through Managed Google Play can be selected and their URLs populated within the console dynamically. When a supported EMM is selected, the URL text box displays with the correct EMM APK URL. A green checkmark to the right of the EMM Agent APK field lets an admin know the APK validation was successful. An error message displays if the selected EMM's APK could not be successfully parsed. The Knox team tests each EMM APK before its made available for selection. EMM Agent APK - Add one or more EMM apps to download automatically upon device enrollment. The primary APK is the EMM solution component that allows KME to activate Knox licenses for enrolled devices. This EMM APK is locally hosted on an intranet server - Select this option to use an APK resource from within a local company Intranet. This option is disabled by default. _Publically available EMM APK_ - Select this option to enter the URL of a publically accessible version of the same EMM APK you are hosting within your enterprise intranet. By default, Samsung suggests a location based on the EMM name you may have previously selected, but this can be overwritten. _Privately available EMM APK_ - If there is no publicly available exact match, select this option and provide the required information associated with the Intranet hosted EMM APK. This is used for validation during device enrollment, and also to display on the Managed Provisioning page. The Admin component name is expressed as _package name/class name_ For example, `com.airwatch.androidagent/com.airwatch.agent.DeviceAdministratorReceiver` for the Workspace ONE UEM. The Admin package signature checksum is the Base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the EMM APK signature, which is URL friendly. You can get this value from your EMM. Go here for information on the EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM. Alternatively, you can use utilities such as _Keytool_ on Linux to get this value. Go here for additional information. The EMM app name is the name of the app displayed on the Managed Provisioning page. The App icon is the icon displayed next to the EMM app name. The minimum size is 48 x 48 pixels, and the file format needs to be a PNG file. EMM Server URI - The EMM URI points to the selected EMM's enterprise installation. This portal connects to the URL internally to download specific configurations. You can update the URI of a profile without having to create a new profile. Verify you can connect to the EMM before proceeding, as the EMM may be behind a firewall or not available from the public Internet. 4. Click CONTINUE to proceed to the Android Enterprise profile settings page to set the EMM configuration and device settings. 5. Under EMM CONFIGURATION, enter the Custom JSON Data (as defined by EMM) to pass the EMM setup configuration using the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Contact your EMM to obtain their JSON template and enterprise specific settings. If Workspace ONE UEM is selected as the Supported EMM, enter custom JSON data that is recognizable to the EMM. An acceptable format would be as follows: ```json ``` 6. Refer to Root/intermediate certificate field to install certificates on devices prior to EMM enrollment as needed. Additional certificates can be downloaded and installed after KME enrollment profile creation. Select the UPLOAD CERTIFICATE FILE button to upload a supported file type. The following certificate file formats are supported - CER, PEM, CRT, DER, and CA-BUNDLE (either inside a ZIP file or applied directly). The P7B, P7S, P12, and PFX formats are not supported. Additionally, CA certificates are supported, not user certificates. With Android 9, root and intermediate certificates are installed in the device default keystore. With Android 10 and higher, root and intermediate certificates are installed in the VPN and app keystores as well as the device's default keystore. 7. (Optional) Select Enable DualDAR to secure the KME enrollment data with two layers of encryption, which applies even when the device is powered off or in an unauthenticated state. Select Enable DualDAR, then click enable to enable this option or cancel to proceed without DualDAR. Once enabled, you can also select Use 3rd party crypto app and select ADD PACKAGE INFORMATION to enter the package name and signature for use with a third-party crypto app. Click SAVE when finished. To use DualDAR on devices, you need a premium or DualDAR license. Contact your reseller to purchase a DualDAR license. DualDAR is only supported on devices running Knox version 3.4 or higher. As of 22.03, DualDAR compatibility has been expanded and is supported for Samsung Galaxy devices in fully managed mode, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S22. If there is no DualDAR license available or active for the account or the device, the device will be locked within 24 hours of enabling the DualDAR option. Once the device is locked, it is rendered unusable. The only way to unlock the device and make it usable is to reset the device to factory settings. For more information, see DualDAR overview. 8. To enroll devices with a QR code, select ADD A QR CODE. QR code plus-sign (+) gesture enrollment is an additional device-side enrollment option in addition to existing Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi Direct options. QR-code-based enrollment is supported on Android 10 and higher devices. Define the following QR code profile configuration settings downloaded to devices during enrollment: Also allow QR code enrollment for devices not uploaded by a reseller - Select this option if you anticipate the need to upload devices from non-resellers. Do not select if there are concerns about unauthorized usage of the QR code data to manipulate Wi-Fi connection data. Once the QR code is generated, this setting also displays within the QR code for this profile page to display how this setting was defined prior to QR code generation. QR code settings - Set whether Wi-Fi data is added to the QR code data by selecting one of the following options: No Wi-Fi network configuration - Select this option to create a QR code with no network data. Add Wi-Fi network configuration to QR code - Select this option to include security data and proxy traffic gateway information within the generated QR code content. When you add Wi-Fi network configuration data, optionally select the Use device MAC address option to include an Android 10 device's factory encoded hardware MAC address within the QR code's Wi-Fi MAC address. Once the QR code is generated, this setting also displays on the QR code for this profile page to display how this setting was defined prior to QR code generation. The MAC address also displays on the Device details page as an additional device MAC address reference point. Wi-Fi settings in the QR code take priority over those associated with the device in the profile, since you first need to connect to Wi-Fi through the QR code before downloading the profile information associated with the device. SSID name - When adding Wi-Fi network connection data within the QR code, a _Service Set Identifier_ (SSID) is required as a network identifier name. Wireless clients use the SSID to identify and join specific wireless networks. Be sure to provide the correct SSID or the generated Wi-Fi QR code will not work. Security - When adding Wi-Fi network data within the QR code, use the Security drop-down menu to specify connection security as either None, WEP, or WPA/WPA2. Selecting None provides no Wi-Fi network security data within the generated QR code, and is not recommended for private networks. WEP provides a somewhat effective passphrase, while WPA/WPA2 is a more secure passphrase using harder to crack protocols. The Samsung Knox team recommends enabling wireless isolation on the network's access point or router resource when adding a Wi-Fi configuration to a QR code. Enabling wireless isolation restricts a wireless computer from accessing other computers connected to the local network, effectively isolating that device on the network. The means to enables wireless isolation differs depending on the router or access point manufacturer. Refer to the documentation available from the manufacturer for their specific instructions on enabling wireless isolation. Select ADD when completed to create the QR code used with the profile. Select the newly created link within the Android enterprise profile settings page to review the generated QR code for this profile page and, if necessary, edit or delete the QR code assigned to the enrollment profile. Once the QR code is generated, a QR code icon displays on the Profiles page to the right of the PROFILE NAME, if enrollment was from the profile contained in the actual QR code. The QR code can also be used to trigger enrollment if the device is pre-assigned to a different profile from the KME console. However, in this case the QR code icon does not display on the Profiles page. 9. Configure the following under DEVICE SETTINGS on the Android enterprise profile settings page: Disable system applications - This option ensures that all apps are disabled and unavailable to the device owner supported profile. Leave all system apps enabled - This option ensures that all pre-installed system apps are enabled and available to the profile. If this option is not selected, only a limited set of default system apps (My Files, Contacts, Google Play Store) display in the device's apps tray. Systems apps reside within the device's `/system/app` read-only folder and cannot be installed or removed by the device user. When using KME with Knox Configure, be careful when unchecking the Leave all system apps enabled checkbox, as this may lead to conflicts with Knox Configure. Privacy Policy, EULAs and Terms of Service - You can show Knox related EULAs (License EULA) together during initial enrollment to reduce the number of pop-ups. In addition to default EULAs, any enterprise and EMM specific EULAs can be added while creating a profile. Select the Samsung Knox Privacy Policy link to review the specific Privacy Policy text displayed to device users based on their geographic region. If needed, select the ADD LEGAL\"AGREEMENT button and enter specific Agreement Title and Agreement Text for the profile. Company Name - Specify the EMM organization name displayed at the time of device enrollment. Enrollment screens - Edit this setting to choose the enrollment screens you want shown, such as the setup wizard. By default, the setup wizard is hidden for both the fully managed and work profile on company-owned device modes. 10. Once enabled, select CREATE to create the device owner supported profile configuration. Refer to the Profiles page to review the newly added profile. Once created, the device owner supported profile displays on the Profiles page as a link that can selected to edit the profile's configuration using these same Android enterprise profile details and Android enterprise profile settings pages. The Profiles page on the Knox Mobile Enrollment console uses ![](../assets/kme-cloned-msp-profile-status.png) to indicate that an EMM profile is a clone of the corresponding Knox MSP Program profile. For more information, see how you can manage profiles on the Knox MSP console. Configure an Android Legacy admin profile To configure an Android Legacy supported KME profile. Android Legacy supported KME profiles are not supported with Android 11 and above supported devices. 1. Select the DEVICE ADMIN option on the Select profile type page. 2. Provide the following BASIC INFORMATION for the Android Legacy profile: _Profile Name_ - Enter an appropriate profile name to distinguish it from others with similar attributes. _Description_ - Optionally provide a 200 character maximum description to further differentiate this profile from others. 3. Set the following EMM INFO for the Android Legacy profile: _EMM Server URI_ - The EMM URI points to the selected EMM's enterprise installation. This portal connects to the URL internally to download specific configurations. You can update the URI of a profile without having to create a new profile. Verify you can connect to the EMM before proceeding, as the EMM may be behind a firewall or not available from the public Internet. Server URI is not required for my EMM - Select this option if you either do not need to point to the EMM's enterprise installation or are unable due to connection restraints. 4. Click CONTINUE to proceed. 5. Set the following EMM CONFIGURATION settings on the Android Legacy profile settings page: EMM Agent APK - Select this option to add one or more EMM applications to be downloaded automatically upon device enrollment when first connecting to Wi-Fi. The primary APK is the EMM solution component allowing KME to activate and utilize Knox licenses for enrolled devices. _Custom JSON Data (as defined by EMM)_ - Enter the Custom JSON Data (as defined by EMM) to pass the EMM setup configuration using the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Contact your EMM to obtain their JSON template and enterprise specific settings. 6. Set the following enrollment, legal, and support information under DEVICE SETTINGS: _Skip Setup Wizard_ - Unselect this option to send the device user through the Setup Wizard. When selected, the device user skips the many setup wizard screens and can start the enrollment process much faster. This setting is selected by default. The US implementation has (Option not currently available on all AT&T devices) appended to the checkbox. _Allow end user to cancel enrollment_ - Selecting this option permits an end-user to cancel enrollment on their device. Leaving this setting unselected enables mandatory device enrollment. The skip setup wizard option functions independently from end-user enrollment cancellation, and both can be enabled at the same time. _Privacy Policy, EULAs and Terms of Service_ - IT admins can show Knox related EULAs (License EULA) together during initial enrollment to reduce the number of pop-ups. In addition to default EULAs, any enterprise and EMM specific EULAs can be added while creating a profile. Select the Samsung Knox Privacy Policy link to review the specific Privacy Policy text displayed to device users based on their geographic region. If needed, select the ADD LEGAL\"AGREEMENT button to enter the Agreement Title and Agreement Text. _Support contact details_ - Select ADD to update the Company Name, Company Address, Contact phone number, and Contact email address displayed on the device upon successful enrollment. If necessary, select Save as default support contact details to use this same information a default contact information. If support for fully managed devices and work profile modes is enabled for the profile, then only the Customer Name is editable, and the remaining parameters are greyed out. _Associate a Knox license with this profile_ - Select this option to pass the Knox license key directly to the intended device for easier Knox profile configuration. 7. Once enabled, select CREATE to create the device admin supported profile configuration. Refer to the Profiles page to review the newly added profile. Once created, the device admin supported profile displays on the Profiles page as a link that can selected to edit the profile's configuration using these same Android Legacy profile details and Android Legacy profile settings pages. Delete or clear profile(s) Enrollment profiles can be permanently removed from the KME console as they become obsolete or bulk cleared if wanting remove multiple profiles in one operation. Profiles with assigned devices cannot be deleted until the devices are applied to a different profile. ##Delete a single profile To delete an individual existing profile: 1. Go to Profiles and select the existing profile you would like to delete. 2. Select the checkbox of a listed profile you intend to delete from the KME console. 3. Click DELETE PROFILE. 4. The Delete profile? dialog displays listing the selected profile. Click DELETE to proceed with the removal. Profile QR code assignment QR code gesture enrollment is a fourth device-side enrollment option for Android 10 and higher devices, in addition to existing Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi Direct options A QR code is a unique matrix style barcode containing information about its attached item. The QR code enrollment process begins with a device plus-sign (+)\"gesture that activates the device's camera in QR code recognition mode. Once a QR code is recognized, a Wi-Fi connection is made and enrollment begins. If there are no Wi-Fi credentials within the QR code, then the device user is prompted to provide them, as these are the Wi-Fi credentials used during device enrollment in fully managed mode. #Review existing profile QR code assignments To review existing device QR code assignments: 1.

            "content": "Enroll your devices. This section covers how to enroll and unenroll devices using KME. In addition to the information described in this topic, a device can be enrolled using the Knox Deployment App (KDA) to either enroll a device using Bluetooth, NFC or Trigger based enrollment. For more information, go to: Using the Knox Deployment App (KDA). Enroll devices Samsung recommends a viable device enrollment plan, as an IT department can become overwhelmed with time-consuming, monotonous tasks that, by themselves, add little value to the organization. An enrollment program helps an organization's IT administrator account for all the devices proliferating their enterprise, and ensure the devices do not introduce security risks through configuration vulnerabilities and malware because they lack aggressive security controls. IT admins can enroll up to 10,000 devices using Knox Mobile Enrollment. If your enterprise needs to enroll more than 10,000, contact Samsung Knox Support. IT admins can provide end users with the following instructions to complete device enrollment: 1. For out of box enrollment, turn on your device and connect to the Internet. 2. When you receive a prompt to Enroll with Knox, tap Continue. If you have any questions or concerns, access the support link on this screen. 3. Read the SECURITY STATEMENT and the Knox PRIVACY POLICY and tap I agree to all of the above; tap Next. 4. Enter the User ID and Password provided by your IT admin and tap Confirm. 5. Your credentials are validated and your device is enrolled in your organization's enterprise IT environment. Root and intermediate certificates can be downloaded and installed after KME enrollment profile creation, but prior to EMM connectivity which may require root certificates to proceed. Unenroll devices To unenroll devices, you need to first remove the IMEI from the Knox Mobile Enrollment portal. After that, a factory reset or MDM console initiated unenrollment can be performed to completely recover the device. If needed, contact your carrier or reseller to obtain the list of the IMEIs of your users' devices. Post enrollment MDM client updates Devices enrolled in KME receive MDM client updates if enrolled directly through the MDM console. Applications must be available in Google Play and an auto-update of Google Play must be enabled. Keep in mind when using additional services with Knox Mobile Enrollment - such as Knox Configure (KC) - if a device upload is approved for KME it is also automatically approved in KC, regardless of the KC upload approval setting. User credential based enrollment types There are three different kinds of user credential based enrollment types, including: 1. A single username and password combination, or a shared secret, used to enroll hundreds of devices. This form of enrollment is called _staging_. This credential is passed in the CSV file. Alternatively, some MDMs use a shared secret to enroll multiple devices. 2. A per device credential configured in the CSV file. It is difficult for admins to associate each device to a user beforehand, so this method (#2) has its shortcomings. Consequently, enrollment type #1 is preferable to #2. 3. A device can be configured without any credentials, but some MDMs do not support this method, so be sure to verify. In most of the cases, it requires end users to input their credentials. Enrollment is not complete until credentials are provided by the end user. This can result in unmanaged and stolen devices. Enroll devices without end user activity You can enroll devices with end user credentials configured on each device before distributing them to their intended users. A staging credential ensures the device is enrolled, but still requires end user input to finalize registration.",

            "content": "Recovering Google FRP-locked devices. This section covers how to recover devices locked with FRP. About FRP Samsung devices utilize built-in security measures to protect devices and their resident information. _Factory reset protection_ (FRP) is one such feature auto-enabled on Android 5.0 and above devices utilizing a Google account. Once enabled, FRP only allows a user with a Google account password to factory reset and activate their device. If an unauthorized individual tries to reset a target device, the device still requires a login using the device owner's Google username and password, so even if a device is lost or stolen, another person cannot conduct a factory reset and manipulate the device. With enterprises, this is very inconvenient since company provided devices lock into an employee's Google account. If the employee were to leave the company, then the device becomes unusable as a company asset. A FRP locked device can be unlocked when enabling the Skip Setup Wizard option during device enrollment. To utilize KME for Google FRP removal To use KME's FRP bypass capability, complete the on a device with the FRP lock set: KME\"can only be used for Google FRP removal on devices utilizing Knox version 2.7.1 or above. 1. Ensure the device is assigned a KME\"profile with the following options properly set: 1. Verify Skip Setup Wizard is enabled for the profile. This setting is enabled by default for DO KME\"profiles, but must be manually enabled for DA KME profiles. For more information on configuring KME DO and DA profiles, go to: Profile configuration. 2. Ensure the user is not allowed to cancel enrollment (the Allow end user to cancel enrollment checkbox is unselected). This setting is disabled by default for DO KME\"profiles, but must be manually disabled for DA KME profiles. For more information on configuring KME DO and DA profiles, go to: Profile configuration. 2. Once the device is assigned a profile with the above settings, perform a hard factory reset using a combination of external button actions (button combinations vary per device). 3. After the device powers on, connect to the network. You will be prompted for a reboot. 4. Perform the reboot. The enrollment will proceed without prompting for Google account login credentials.",

Refer to the KME Resellers screen to register Samsung-approved reseller(s) so Samsung can verify their device ownership and assist in preventing erroneous enrolments. The reseller screen lists each reseller, their ID, default profile and upload approval preference. Optionally select the REGISTER RESELLER button to lookup reseller IDs, select a default profile to assign to devices purchased from this reseller and set their upload approval preference. When a device is purchased from a reseller, the reseller can automatically upload the device to your KME account. The uploaded devices display within the DEVICES > Uploads page. Add a reseller The Resellers screen displays a list of resellers, their corresponding reseller ID, deployment country, profile auto-assignment designation, default enrollment profile and upload approval preference. Each reseller displays as a link that can be selected to edit that reseller's profile and approval preferences. To add a reseller: 1. Contact your carrier or reseller for their required Reseller ID by providing your own customer ID. 2. Select Resellers from the left-hand navigation menu. The Resellers screen lists your Customer ID that you will need to provide to your reseller. Be sure to make a note of it, as it does not appear any place else in the Knox Mobile Enrollment console. 3. Select the REGISTER RESELLER button from the top, right-hand, side of the Resellers screen. 4. Enter the Reseller ID provided by your reseller. Once entered, select the newly displayed LOOK\"UP button. Wait momentarily until a Reseller found confirmation displays the successful identification of the reseller. If you encounter errors with the ID, contact your reseller to ensure it is correct. 5. Select the REGISTER button. 6.

Auto assign profile after approval - Use the drop-down menu to select the default profile assigned to devices uploaded by this particular reseller once manually or automatically approved. 7. If necessary, refer to the Additional profiles field near the bottom of the screen and define a Profile and a Profile alias that are shared with a reseller to automatically assign profiles to approved uploads. Once created, the reseller can attach the profile alias to an upload which the customer in turn uses for a profile auto-assignment rule. However, the reseller must be sure which alias to use per upload, so this feature should only be used when a reseller has coordinated with the customer regarding which profile alias to sue. For more information on profile auto-assignments, go to: Profile auto-assignments. Profile aliases are not shared across resellers, so they are not unique across resellers but unique per reseller. There can be up to 10 aliases per reseller, but a profile alias can only be associated with a single profile. Try to keep aliases simple and easy to remember. Profile aliases are not required, and it is up to the reseller to optionally use. However, when created, an alias must be associated with an existing profile. 8. If wanting to delete a reseller, ensure the DELETE button is enabled, which specifies there are there are currently no reseller devices utilized by a Knox Cloud Service. When enabled, select the DELETE button to proceed with the reseller removal. However, if there are currently still devices associated with a reseller, the following tooltip displays to let an admin know that devices will require reseller re-assignment to proceed with the reseller deletion. 9.

            "content": "Role-based access control. Role-based access control (RBAC) allows customer (tenant) admins responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their enterprise requirements dictate. Though KME utilizes admin roles unique to the KME\"service, a Super Admin cuts across all services. With RBAC, existing customers have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) are assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned, can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. For detailed information on adding an administrator and assigning them their required roles and permissions, go to: Adding an admin and assigning roles and permissions. Migrate existing admins to RBAC KME has different permissions available to its administrators. Every combination of service permissions is mapped to a different role. The role names are generic by default, but can be modified based on your organization's naming requirements. For example, a KME admin with the ability to invite other admins will be mapped to \"KME Role 1\". Or a KME Admin with the ability to both (i) delete and (ii) un-assign profiles from devices will be mapped to \"KME Role 2\". Create a role and assign permissions Each Knox Cloud Service, including KME, has different permissions that can be combined and assigned a role. Most permission categories within the Create role screen have a View only option that only permit an admin with this role to view items with no configuration, device or reseller administration permitted. New roles have the view only permission enabled by default. Existing roles that inherit a View only permission have it turned off by default, to prevent issues. Once the required Role name is defined, specific permissions can be selected by category as needed for the particular role. New administrator roles receive some basic permissions by default, but additional permissions require assignment for individual roles. Keep in mind, a role must be first created before an administrator can be invited to that role. NOTE - Enable Allow access to Knox Deployment Application to use the Knox Deployment App (KDA) exclusively for device enrollment into KME, without the use of the KME console. When relying on the KDA without the KME console an admin must login to the KDA, choose a service (KME, KC, KG, etc.), select a profile, pair the primary/admin device with a target device, and assign the profile to the target device. For more information on using the KDA, go to: Knox Deployment App (KDA). Invite a user to be an administrator with a defined role Existing users require an invitation to become an administrator. However, as noted previously, a role must first be created that can be assigned to the administrator. A different Invite administrator screen could display stating that before an administrator can be invited a role must be first created and available for assignment. Ensure appropriate roles and permissions are created and available before proceeding with an administrator invitation. Once an appropriate role is available, provide the name and Email address serving as the administrator's contact resource, then select the Role assignment for this specific administrator. View roles Once roles are created and assigned to administrators, they can be reviewed to assess whether the role name requires modification or its permissions need refinement. If needed, more than one administrator can be assigned the same role. The number of administrators assigned a particular role displays as a numeric link that can selected to view the names of the assigned administrators. User interface customization for particular roles The KME console is customized for each role, depending on the permissions granted. For example, an Admin without Administration Privileges will not display Administrators & Roles in the left-hand navigation menu.",

            "content": "Use the Knox Deployment App. The Knox Deployment App is a mobile application available from the Google Play Store that is uniquely designed to help streamline the enterprise deployment of Samsung phones and tablets running Knox 2.8 or higher. The Knox Deployment App enables customers to seamlessly enroll devices using Knox mobility solutions. About The Knox Deployment App provides the flexible option to IT admins needing to bulk enroll end-user devices without having a reseller. Using this app allows IT Admins to reduce their bulk deployment time, by using a primary device without factory resetting each device. Once enrolled, an IT admin can easily locate the devices within the Knox solution console. The Knox Deployment App does not support the enrollment of Samsung devices without Knox. Look at this list of supported devices to check whether your device is supported or not. NFC enrollment With Near Field Communication (NFC) enrollments, a non-B2B device is \"bumped\" (held closely together) with another smartphone device with Knox Deployment App running and scanning in NFC mode. The dedicated primary NFC device displays profiles available for enrollment and end user device enrollment begins once an IT admin selects a profile. The NFC enrollment option is not available to tablet devices. For more information, go to: NFC deployment. NFC is not supported with Android 11 device deployments, and is not available on the device's swipe menu. Bluetooth enrollment To support Bluetooth-based enrollments, an IT admin can install the Samsung Knox Deployment App on a dedicated admin/primary smartphone or tablet device, and select existing profiles. If the user's device is within proximity of the primary device, the user device connects to the admin device wirelessly via Bluetooth without a PIN or password requirement. For more information, go to: Bluetooth deployment. Wi-Fi Direct enrollment Wi-Fi Direct supported devices can connect directly to each other through a WLAN, without joining a traditional wireless network or Wi-Fi hotspot. Once enabled, the device automatically scans for other supported Wi-Fi direct devices. Once discovered, specific devices can be selected for enrollment data transfer. For more information, go to: Wi-Fi Direct deployment. Using the Knox Deployment App does not apply the profile to the admin/primary device. It only broadcasts the profile to the devices in the vicinity. Additionally, only end-user devices within physical proximity of the admin/primary device with an active Knox Deployment App can enroll. The screens utilized within this guide are from a smartphone. If running the Knox Deployment App on a tablet, the information on the screen would be identical, just optimized to fit the tablet's display capabilities. #App version information Knox Deployment App version information and available open source licenses can be referenced from within the ABOUT screen. Samsung recommends you periodically compare the Knox Deployment App's version to the latest available from Samsung to ensure you have the latest feature set and functionality available. To launch the Knox Deployment App's ABOUT screen: Refer to the listed version number and note the version. If needed, select Open source licenses to review the open source licenses available to your Knox deployment. Prerequisites 1. The IT admin must create a Knox Portal account and ensure: Your devices support the Bluetooth, NFC (Android 10 or below), or Wi-Fi Direct protocols. Check your device specification if unsure. You have at least one profile configured in your Knox solution portal. 2. Get the appropriate licenses to enroll devices (through the Samsung Knox Portal for KC or KG). KME does not require a license. 3. Install the Knox Deployment App on an admin/primary device, and login using their Knox Portal ID/password. 4. Select a profile on the primary device to apply to the end-user devices. 5. Ensure that the device you are enrolling has not already been uploaded to a KCS service. KDA is only designed for use with one KCS service at a time. Devices already enrolled via KDA can then be reassigned or updated through the KCS console it was uploaded to. To avoid encountering issues with KDA enrollment, please ensure you remove your device from any KCS services it is in before using KDA to enroll in another. Find more information about it here. 6. Two-factor authentication will be mandatory for all IT admins using Knox Deployment Application. Refer to 2FA for more details. The Knox Deployment App does not support the enrollment of Samsung devices without Knox. Look at this list of supported devices to check whether your device is supported or not. Two-factor authentication To allow the Knox Deployment App (KDA) to leverage Samsung Account's security features (like login alert, trusted device management, force logout, account activity history, and so on) two-factor authentication (2FA) will be required when logging in to KDA. A user who does not have 2FA set up will be directed to configure 2FA first. A user who logs in to KDA effectively logs in with their Samsung Account on the entire device - not just KDA. In addition, the minimum Knox version for KDA is now Knox 2.8 (Android 7.1). The following are accepted as the second form of authentication: Phone number, Authenticator app (such as Microsoft Authenticator, Google OTP, and so on), Verification code sent to other Galaxy devices, Backup codes The following are the user impacts: Once the user has successfully logged in, they no longer need to log in again. Once the user has set up 2FA on their account, it will also be required when they log in to Samsung Knox. Users using a personal Samsung Account for B2C services (for example, Samsung Health, SmartThings, and so on) will not be able to log in to KDA on the same device with their enterprise account. They will need to log out of their personal account first. For more information, see the FAQs for two-step verification. Using the Knox Deployment App This section describes the screen flow navigation for a typical enrollment using the Knox Deployment App. 1. Select SIGN IN once the Knox Deployment App launches on the device. If the Knox Deployment App is already running on the device, the initial screen does not display, and the application displays the sign in screen. Make sure to sign out of any Samsung account from the device if it is not the correct account for desired deployment or doesn't have Knox Deployment permission. If the account does not have Knox Deployment permission, the app will ask you to sign out of the current account and sign into one with this permission. 2. Enter the Knox Portal Username and Password to login into the Knox Deployment App using 2FA. If you encounter difficulty logging in to the Knox Deployment App, ensure you have either a valid Knox Portal account with privileges for the Knox solution you are trying to enroll in. If that is not the issue, select Forgot your email or password?on Knox Portal login for assistance retrieving your login credentials. Once you have successfully logged into the Knox Deployment App, a WELCOME screen displays providing first-time options for profile selection and deployment mode selection. Once the Knox Deployment App profile selection and configuration mode are set, the selected options display within their respective fields, the START DEPLOYMENT screen flow enables, and the Welcome portion of screen no longer displays in subsequent logins. Profile selection Select a profile to utilize within the Knox Deployment App to apply specific device settings to the primary admin device using Bluetooth, NFC, or Wi-Fi Direct to enroll end user devices. To select a configuration profile using the Knox Deployment App: 1. Select Tap here to select a profile from the Welcome screen to display a list of profile selection options. 2. Optionally filter whether all profiles are listed for potential selection or just KC or KME defined profiles. The most recent profile additions display first within their respective categories. Each listed profile has a brief description to help determine its relevance to a particular device enrollment mode option using the Knox Development App. An important distinction to the profile description is the profile's relevance to mobile devices versus wearable devices. If needed, select the Search icon near the top of the screen to display a search field where existing profiles can be located and displayed. The search function only locates filtered profiles. If no profiles are available, a profile requires registration using the Knox solution console at SamsungKnox.com. Select a listed profile. Once selected, the profile displays upon subsequent logins.

            "content": "Use the Knox Deployment App. The Knox Deployment App is a mobile application available from Google Play that is uniquely designed to help streamline the enterprise deployment of Samsung phones and tablets running Knox 2.8 or higher. About the Knox Deployment App The Knox Deployment App allows you to enroll devices without a reseller, one device at a time. This app simplifies device enrollment by allowing you to use a primary device to enroll a secondary device, without factory resetting it. Once enrolled, you can easily locate the devices within your console. You can also test other Knox cloud services prior to contacting your reseller for bulk device upload. Using the Knox Deployment App doesn't apply the profile to the admin or primary device. It only broadcasts the profile to devices that are in close physical proximity to the primary device. Hence, only devices within physical proximity of the admin or primary device - with the Knox Deployment App installed - can enroll. Furthermore, device users using a personal Samsung account for other services such as Samsung Health, SmartThings, among others, won't be able to sign in to the Knox Deployment App on the same device with their enterprise account. They'll need to sign out of their personal account first. The Knox Deployment App supports the following ways of enrolling devices: Bluetooth enrollment - To support Bluetooth-based enrollments, you can install the Knox Deployment App on a dedicated admin/primary smartphone or tablet device, and select existing profiles. If the user's device is within proximity of the primary device, the user device connects to the admin device wirelessly via Bluetooth without a PIN or password requirement. For more information, go to Bluetooth deployment. Wi-Fi Direct enrollment - Wi-Fi Direct supported devices can connect directly to each other through a WLAN, without joining a traditional wireless network or Wi-Fi hotspot. Once enabled, the device automatically scans for other supported Wi-Fi direct devices. Once discovered, specific devices can be selected for enrollment data transfer. For more information, go to Wi-Fi Direct deployment. Prerequisites 1. You must create a Samsung Knox account and ensure: Your device supports Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. You have at least one profile configured in your Samsung Knox account. 2. Samsung devices that run Samsung Knox. Currently, the Knox Deployment App doesn't support the enrollment of Samsung devices without Samsung Knox. See the list of supported devices to determine compatibility. 3. Get the appropriate licenses to enroll devices through the Knox Admin Portal. Knox Mobile Enrollment doesn't require a license. Knox Configure and Knox Guard require a license. 4. Install the Knox Deployment App on an admin or primary device, and sign in using your Samsung Knox credentials. 5. Select a profile on the primary device to apply to the devices. 6. Ensure that the device you are enrolling hasn't already been uploaded to a Knox cloud service. The Knox Deployment App is only designed for use with one Knox cloud service at a time. Devices already enrolled via the Knox Deployment App can then be reassigned or updated through the KCS console it was uploaded to. To avoid issues with the Knox Deployment App enrollment, unenroll your device from any Knox cloud services it is enrolled in prior to using the Knox Deployment App for enrollment. See the FAQ about the Knox Deployment App being enrolled to only one Knox cloud service for more information. 7. Enable mandatory two-factor authentication. Using the Knox Deployment App To get started with using the Knox Deployment App, you must: 1. Tap Sign in once the Knox Deployment App launches on the device. If the Knox Deployment App is already running on the device, the initial screen isn't displayed, and the application displays the sign-in screen. 2. Enter your Knox Admin Portal username and password. Note that you'll have to set up two-factor authentication. For more information, see the two-step verification FAQs. Once you have successfully signed in to the Knox Deployment App, the Welcome screen displays options for selecting a profile and a deployment mode. Profile selection You can select a profile to use within the Knox Deployment App. To select a configuration profile: 1. Select Tap here to select a profile from the Welcome screen to display a list of profiles. 2. (Optional) Filter profiles if you'd like to see only the profiles that are associated either with Knox Mobile Enrollment or Knox Configure. Additionally, you can interact with these profiles, as follows: The most recently added profiles are displayed first within their respective categories. Each listed profile briefly describes its relevance to a particular device enrollment option, based on the Knox Development App. If needed, tap the Search icon to search existing profiles. Note that this search function locates only filtered profiles. If no profiles are available, create a profile on the Knox Admin Portal. 3. Select a listed profile. Once selected, this profile is displayed upon subsequent logins. The profile is now ready for Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct deployment. Bluetooth deployment To enroll and deploy devices using the Bluetooth option: 1. Navigate to the Select deployment mode screen and select Bluetooth as the device deployment mode. 2. Set the Bluetooth duration to either 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, or 8 hours. Tap OK to save the update. The Bluetooth duration is the deployment activation period for device user devices after they receive the profile from your primary device. Once the set duration expires, devices cannot enroll with the Knox Deployment App, and the process must be repeated to continue the enrollment of other required devices. 1. The Accept automatically option automatically accepts pairing requests from enrolling devices. When selected, the pairing dialogue is displayed neither on the primary device nor the receiving device. 2. The device must remain ON for the entire Bluetooth duration, so ensure battery resources are available if selecting a longer duration option. 3. If setting up a Wi-Fi connection for the device, select Wi-Fi for deployed devices, and select either a saved or an available network resource for connection. The following restrictions apply for the Wi-Fi for deployed devices setting: Only out-of-box deployments are supported. These deployments use a plus sign (+) gesture on a device's Welcome screen to start an out-of-box deployment and bypass the setup wizard. The receiver device must run Knox 3.2 or higher. Wi-Fi credentials passed to the target device are for WEP, WPA and WPA2 Wi-Fi security types. 4. On the Knox Deployment App screen, tap Start deployment to initiate the configured Bluetooth duration interval. 1. As long as the Bluetooth duration window is still active, and the app is running on the device foreground, the device display won't time out. 2. Bluetooth and the device location must be turned on and must run actively on the device for successful deployment. 5. The device user must visit https://me.samsungknox.com and follow the displayed instructions. 6. The device user then taps Finish deployment to complete the enrollment. Wi-Fi Direct deployment Only out-of-box deployments are supported. These deployments use a plus sign (+) gesture on a device's Welcome screen to start an out-of-box deployment and bypass the setup wizard. To enroll and deploy devices using Wi-Fi Direct: 1. From the admin primary device, navigate to the Select deployment mode screen and select Wi-Fi Direct as the device deployment mode. 2. Once Wi-Fi Direct is selected as the deployment mode, specify whether the Wi-Fi Direct connection is automatic or manual: Accept manually - Requires a device user to enter a system-generated PIN every time a connection is requested from an enrolling device. This is the default setting. Accept automatically - Automatically accept connection requests from enrolling devices. #Accept connection requests manually To establish a manual Wi-Fi Direct connection: A Wi-Fi Direct manual connection requires a PIN be entered correctly before the expiration of a timer. 1. Tap Accept manually from the Select Wi-Fi Direct screen when prompted. 2. Note the displayed PIN needed to proceed with the manual Wi-Fi Direct connection. 3. Tap Connect before the countdown expires. An Accept sharing request dialog prompts you to enter the required PIN before the countdown timer expires. 4. Enter the PIN and tap Accept. This enables the listed primary/admin device to share enrollment information via the newly established Wi-Fi Direct connection. 5. Tap Finish deployment on the admin or primary device to finish enrollment. #Accept connection requests automatically To establish an automatic Wi-Fi Direct connection: 1. Tap Accept automatically from the Select Wi-Fi Direct screen when prompted. 2. Tap Connect before the countdown expires to initiate a Wi-Fi Direct connection with the primary or admin device. This enables the listed device to share enrollment information via the newly established Wi-Fi Direct connection. 3. Tap Finish deployment on the primary or admin device to finish enrollment.",

Advanced profiles offer supplementary features that provide additional controls to conditionally allow automatic device enrollment locking and information theft protection. If you apply an advanced profile to a device that was enrolled without an active Knox Suite license, the additional features provided by the advanced profile won't be available. In other words, you will be able to apply the advanced profile, but none of the advanced features will function. You can create an advanced profile in a process similar to that for regular profiles: 1. On the Knox Mobile Enrollment console, go to Profiles, then click Create Profile. 2. Click Android Enterprise (Advanced) as the profile type. 3. Enter the Android Enterprise (Advanced) profile settings for the advanced profile. For more information, repeat steps 1 - 3 in Android Enterprise profiles. 4. Click Continue to configure the profile settings page. To set the EMM configuration and device settings, repeat steps 4 - 9 in Android Enterprise profiles. 5. Click Continue to configure advanced settings: 1. The Lock unenrolled devices feature allows you to automatically lock a device if it isn't enrolled in an EMM within a window of time specified in the Lock device field and prevent device users from bypassing enrollment. This feature is turned on by default. 2. Set a time window in the Lock device field by setting the time window to be 1 - 30 days (default is 7 days) after a profile is pushed to a device. The enrollment status is checked once per day, until the time window is reached. 3. Click Immediately lock a device to immediately lock a device if it becomes rooted or starts running unofficial firmware. 4. (Optional) Enter a Lock Message to show to the device user when the device is locked. 5. Enter a 10-digit phone number that the device user can contact you on, if the device is locked. The number must contain hyphens (-) separating the number sequences. For example, 408-555-1234 is a well-formed phone number. 6. Click Create to finish creating the profile. Congratulations! You have successfully created an advanced profile, and it's now available in the list of profiles on the Profiles page. The Profile Type column marks it as Android Enterprise (Advanced).

With the ability to lock lost or stolen devices and unlock devices in offline environments, advanced profiles help you protect your data in such adverse scenarios.

On the Devices page, if the device profile status is Unenrolled and the device lock status is Locked: 1. Select a device IMEI and click PIN. 2. In the Unlock device dialog, enter the 8-digit code that is displayed on the device user's lock screen. 3. Click Continue to generate a one-time 8-digit PIN. 4. Share the generated PIN with the device user. The device user enters this PIN to unlock their device. Recovering a device locked by factory reset protection Factory reset protection prevents a device from being factory reset without confirmation from its primary Google Account. This feature is auto-enabled on devices running Android 5 or higher. Unauthorized individuals won't be able to reset such a device, protecting device information even when the device is lost or stolen. Because the primary profile on a company-owned device is typically a Google Account controlled by the worker who was issued the device, deactivating or reassigning the worker can can thwart efforts to re-initialize the device, because factory reset protection will still require the original worker's account credentials in order to proceed. As a result, the device might become unusable as an enterprise asset. Fortunately, it's possible for enterprises to bypass factory reset protection on Samsung devices. To bypass factory reset protection on a relinquished device: 1. Ensure that the device is assigned either an Android Enterprise or Android Enterprise (Advanced) profile with the following options: 2. Factory reset the device. 3. After the device powers on, select the system language and connect to a Wi-Fi network. The device then prompts you to reboot. 4. Tap Restart now to reboot the device. The enrollment proceeds without prompting you to enroll with a Google Account.",

Knox Mobile Enrollment lets you create, assign, and manage Android Enterprise profiles that are either fully managed or work profiles on company-owned devices running Android 11 or higher. Before you can enroll devices, you need to create a profile or edit an existing profile. Additionally, there are no limits to the number of profiles you can create and assign to devices. Create a profile To create an Android Enterprise profile: When creating a profile within the console, the characters (# / $ * % ^ & \\ ( ) + ? [ ] ) aren't allowed. 1. On the Profiles page, click Create profile. 2. Select Android Enterprise as the profile type. 3. Enter a Profile name. 4. (Optional) Enter a description, containing up to 200 characters. 5. Select an EMM. See Knox partner solutions for a list of EMMs that Knox Mobile Enrollment supports. If you select Other, manually enter the EMM agent APK. This APK lets you add one or more EMM apps that'll be downloaded automatically upon device enrollment. To use this APK resource from within a local intranet, check This EMM APK is locally hosted on an intranet server. 6. If the EMM APK is locally hosted, you must configure Publicly available EMM APKs - the URL of a publicly accessible version of the same EMM APK you are hosting within your enterprise intranet. 7. If the EMM APK isn't locally hosted, you must configure Privately available EMM APKs - this information is used for validation during device enrollment and display on the Managed Provisioning page. You'll need to provide the following information: Admin component page - This is displayed as _package name_/_class name_. Admin package signature checksum - This is the Base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the EMM APK signature, which is URL friendly. You can get this value from your EMM. See the Android Device admin signature checksum documentation for more information. Alternatively, you can use the Keytool utility on Linux to get the signature checksum value. EMM app name - This is the name of the app displayed on the Managed Provisioning page. App icon - This icon is displayed next to the EMM app name. The minimum size is 48 X 48 pixels in PNG file format. 8. Enter the EMM server URI. This URI points to the EMM's installation portal for downloading specific EMM configurations. Verify you can connect to the EMM, since it may be firewall-protected or unavailable on public networks. 9. Click Continue to set the Android Enterprise profile settings. 10. (Optional) Provide Custom JSON Data (as defined by EMM) to set up the EMM. Contact your EMM's vendor to obtain their JSON template and enterprise-specific settings. 11. (Optional) Specify a root/intermediate certificate that will be installed on devices during device enrollment. Only certificates with .cer, .pem, .crt, .der and .ca-bundle file types are supported. This feature is available on devices running Android 9 or later. 12. (Optional) Enable DualDAR to secure the enrollment data with two layers of encryption. Once enabled, optionally check Use 3rd party crypto app and add the package name, package URL, and signature for use with a third-party crypto app. Click Save when finished. You must have a Knox DualDAR license which you can purchase from Knox license resellers. See DualDAR overview for more information. 13. Click Add a QR code to enroll devices with a QR code. QR-code-based enrollment is supported on devices running Android 10 or higher. 14. Set the QR code settings: 1. You can allow QR code enrollment for devices not uploaded by a reseller. 2. Set whether Wi-Fi data is added to the QR code data by selecting one of the following options: 1. Select No Wi-Fi network configuration to create a QR code with no network data. 2. Select Add Wi-Fi network configuration to QR code to include security data and proxy traffic gateway information within the generated QR code content. Optionally check Use device MAC address to include the factory-encoded hardware MAC address within the QR code's Wi-Fi MAC address. Wi-Fi settings in the QR code take priority over those associated with the device in the profile, since you first need to connect to Wi-Fi through the QR code before downloading the profile information associated with the device. 3. Set the SSID settings - Provide an SSID name. Then, select the type of connection security from the Security list. This type can be either None, WEP, or WPA/WPA2. Selecting None provides no Wi-Fi network security data within the generated QR code, and is not recommended for private networks. WEP provides a somewhat effective passphrase, while WPA/WPA2 is a more secure passphrase using harder to crack protocols. 3. Click Add to create the QR code. Click the newly created link on the Android Enterprise profile settings page to review the generated QR code for this profile page and, if necessary, edit or delete the QR code assigned to the enrollment profile. 4. Once the QR code is generated, a QR code icon is displayed on the Profiles page, if enrollment was from the profile contained in the actual QR code. You can also use the QR code to trigger enrollment if the device is pre-assigned to a different profile from the console.

            "content": "About Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct is the on-premise version of Knox Mobile Enrollment. It aims to simplify the initial setup and enrollment of corporate-owned devices in a closed network or on premise of how Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct works. #Key features Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct offers the following key features: Simple provisioning - The device user does not need to perform any activities for setting up and configuring the device beyond unboxing the device and scanning a QR code. Automated workflow - IT admins can automate all activities in the workflow, right from network connection properties to device configuration such as security and privacy settings or display properties. #Key benefits Over and above these core features, Samsung's Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct provides the following device enrollment benefits: Configure once, deploy multiple times - For enterprise IT admins, setting up and configuring hundreds or thousands of enterprise devices can mean a labor intensive, manual process. With Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, IT admins can create a configuration profile and send a QR code to the device user so that the device user can unbox, set up, and configure their own devices. IT admins can create multiple configuration profiles, one for each device use case, and share these with the device users. For example, the IT admin can create one device profile for a sales person, another for a customer support representative, and yet another for an HR employee. Each profile is associated with one generated QR code. When the device user or employee scans the appropriate QR code on their device, the appropriate set up and configuration profile is installed on their enterprise device. No hassle device set up and configuration - Setting up and configuring devices in a closed network or on premise environment generally requires the enterprise's IT admin or the device user to follow a set of procedures on the target device. This process often involves turning on the device and manually applying the appropriate settings or maybe just pushing a device configuration profile using an MDM. This manual process often creates problems, resulting in IT teams having to spend time guiding frustrated employees through the process. With Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, this entire process is automated and does not require any support from the IT admin. As soon as the employee receives their device, powers it on, and scans the QR code, the device automatically installs the required software and applies the security settings and configurations provisioned by the enterprise. Mobile security management - With Samsung Knox, the integrity of the entire device is protected from hardware to the application layer. With Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, IT admins can set security policies without physically touching the device. IT admins can retain total device control. #Workflow The Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct workflow offers a streamlined method of configuring device profiles and allowing device users to use an automated method of setting up their devices. The workflow is as follows: 1. The enterprise's IT admin purchases devices either from their Samsung representative, a Reseller, or a mobile carrier. 2. The IT Admin now uses a Windows 10 device to sign in to Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct download page and download the PC application. 3. The IT admin follows the on-screen prompts to enter the activation request key, generate the license activation key, review terms and conditions, and open the application on their device. 4. The IT Admin uses the PC application to configure the devices by assigning them to a device configuration profile and optionally adding username and password information to each device. The IT admin can also automatically assign devices to a profile. Before you use Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct to manage a device, the IT admin must first erase the devices' unique ID from Knox Mobile Enrollment cloud since Knox Mobile Enrollment cloud profiles are higher priority than Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct profiles. Otherwise, the Knox Mobile Enrollment cloud profile will override Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct profile.",

You can download and use KME Direct to configure device profiles to automate setting up and configuration of target devices. This KME Direct v1.0.4 release is scheduled to go live on March 31, 2021 and includes the following features: Add on-premise support for KME Cloud, Generate and share QR codes with device users, Automate device set up and configuration Add on-premise support for KME Cloud KME Direct aims to simplify the initial setup and enrollment of corporate-owned and employee-owned devices in a closed network or on-premise environment where devices are activated and used with little configuration variance amongst the devices deployed. KME Direct helps streamline the set up and standardize the configuration of devices within an organization's closed network environment. Learn more about KME Direct's key features. Generate and share QR codes with device users For enterprise IT admins, setting up and configuring hundreds or thousands of enterprise devices can mean a labor intensive, manual process. With KME Direct, IT admins can create a configuration profile and send a QR code to the device user so that the device user can unbox, set up, and configure their own devices. IT admins can create multiple configuration profiles, one for each device use case, and share these with the device users. For more information see Create new profiles. Automate device set up and configuration Setting up and configuring devices in a closed network or on-premise environment generally requires the enterprise's IT admin or the device user to follow a set of procedures on the target device. With KME Direct, this entire process is automated and does not require any support from the IT admin. As soon as the employee receives their device, powers it on, and scans the QR code, the device automatically installs the required software and applies the security settings and configurations provisioned by the enterprise. For more information see Set up and configuration for device users. Back to release notes",

KME Direct is the on-premise version of KME, allowing you to configure device profiles to automate the setup and configuration of target devices. This KME Direct v1.1 release is scheduled to go live on August 3, 2021 and includes the following features: Added an option to select QR code type for legacy devices, Improved the QR code recognition rate, Added support for Samsung SDS EMM (On-Prem) and other EMMs, Enhanced form field labels and tooltips text, Fixed issues and bugs raised by customers Option to select QR code type for legacy devices IT admins can now create a configuration profile and select the QR code type to send and scan. Since there are different versions of QR code formats, and old devices cannot recognize the new version containing any-order QR codes, the admin can now manually select a current or legacy version of the code. The current version is suited when working with devices on Android S OS and newer. The new version of QR codes works for devices running Android S OS and higher. The legacy version works for devices running Android R OS. Note that you must scan the legacy codes in sequential order. Improved QR code recognition rate Along with the option to select a QR code type for legacy devices, the QR code recognition rate is improved for both scanning on device screens and print outs. There is a higher successful recognition rate on first scan attempt when compared to the previous release. Support for Samsung SDS EMM (On-Prem) and other EMMs The KME Direct V1.1 release also provides IT admins with the option to enroll devices to Samsung SDS EMM and other EMMs. The EMM vendor list now includes an option to select Samsung SDS EMM or Other. If you select the Samsung SDS EMM option, all required fields are automatically filled for ease of use. The auto-filled fields include the following values: APK URL, Admin package component name, and Admin app signature checksum. If you select Other, then the required fields are left blank and you can edit them based on information provided in the form of tooltips. Form field and guiding text changes The Create a New Profile screen includes changes to field labels. For example, what was previously known as the \"Name\" field under \"Wi-Fi network information\" is now renamed to \"SSID Name\". This change makes it easier to understand the information needed and helps you complete a new profile quickly. Refer to Set up and configuration for IT admins and see the sections Create device configuration profiles and Create device deployment profiles for the latest field names. Bug fixes The KME Direct V1.1 release also includes a few bug fixes. These fixes include the following: Added missing mandatory fields during initial profile creation, Added a missing field input checker to verify passcode rules, URI format, and the uniqueness of profile names, Added support for Corporate owned device with work profile (COPE) mode Back to release notes",

This Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct v1.2 release is scheduled to go live on November 19, 2021 and includes the following features: Added AE WP-C support (configuration), Added multi-time configuration via QR scan, Added built-in relay server, Enhanced mobile network configuration, Enhanced enrollment through USB Ethernet, Updated form fields and guiding text Android Enterprise WP-C support (configuration) The console now supports configuration for WP-C devices. Originally, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct only supported DO/Fully managed devices. With the new release, the console introduces a more general Device Deployment Profile. This allows for the option to Let MDM choose to enroll as a Device Owner or Profile Owner, instead of forcing Device Owner enrollment. To learn more about different device management modes, refer to the Knox device manage mode page, or Google Android Enterprise documentation. Multi-time configuration via QR scan This release also introduces the ability to apply new XML configurations multiple times simply by scanning a QR code from the Camera app. This is helpful to IT admins who want to change the settings of devices that are already distributed to end-users and running in the field. Once XML and QR codes with the new settings are created, they can be uploaded to the relay server. Then, devices can simply scan this QR code and download the new XML settings. If the device has been previously configured with KSP through Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, configuration updates can now be pushed through QR codes. The code can be generated containing the link to the XML file and KSP can simply download and apply the latest configuration. The XML QR is different from the enrollment QR code. Built-in relay server Now, when you run Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct on your PC, a relay server is installed. With this, you'll be able to pick a specific folder to share with devices during configuration of the relay server. You can store XML files to the shared folder at the end of XML profile creation. During the installation, the Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct app suggests the URL using your current IP address, the port, and the shared folder by default. When the relay server is installed and running, every URL and URI related to it will be filled automatically as editable text when creating QR codes for device configuration profiles. The relay server can be stopped independently of the Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct tool. Mobile network configuration With version 1.2, you'll be able to configure device networks during device configuration and set the following: Enable / Disable roaming (including voice/text and data) , Add Access Point Names , Specify Name, APN, Proxy, Port, Username, Password, Serve , Specify MCC, MNC, Authentication type (None, PAP, CHAP, PAP or CHAP), APN type, APN Protocol (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4/IPv6), and APN roaming protocol , Confirm your MMS and MVNO Enrollment through USB Ethernet You can now enroll your devices through a USB Ethernet connection without Wi-Fi or a mobile network connection. Under Device Deployment Profile > Network , the default is to set up Wi-Fi, but you'll have the option to change it if you would prefer enrollment through USB Ethernet instead. This is useful for completely closed network environments without public internet connection. Additional form field and guiding text updates This version 1.2 release includes additional text changes to form field labels and guiding tooltips. Also, to ensure consistent terminology among Knox products, the previous use of _KME Direct_ will be updated to the full name of Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct.

            "content": "Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct 1.3 release notes. The Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct v1.3 release is scheduled to go live on March 31, 2022 and includes the following features: Simplifications to server settings with pre-defined fields Server settings have been simplified for faster navigation in KME Direct v1.3, including pre-defined fields for Device Configuration Profiles (XML files) and within global settings. Details on the pre-population as well as additional changes are as follows: All configurations related to built-in relay servers - if selected, and regardless of running status - are automatically populated, such as Shared folder , URI , and Port. Made the Signature checksum field optional. Removed Device Configuration Profile > XML settings from the profile creation page and the profile sliding panel. Updated the Summary page to display GENERATE XML/QR CODE instead of CONTINUE. Updated the UI on Device Deployment Profile > Additional deployment options: Provide a drop-down list of Device Configuration XML file names. Allow you to manually enter the local server URI, if needed. Show a pop-up when you select CREATE NEW PROFILE from the drop-down. Maintain XML files created before v1.3 with their original file name, which appear in the same dropdown list. Refer to Set up and configuration for IT admins to see the latest instructions with all the changes. Updates to initial profile selection page layout Previously, the profile creation process would begin with the Select profile type page, with the Device Configuration Profile and Device Deployment Profile options being shown side-by-side. With the new release, this page has been redesigned to better show the sequential relationship between the 2 profile types. Now, the profile types are shown vertically, with icons to the left and detailed descriptions to the right. Character limit for Device Configuration QR codes When creating a new Configuration Profile, the profile name now has a 30-character limit. This name is used for a URI-encoded XML file name, which is combined with either the built-in or local server URI to form the full URI. A QR code is then generated with the full URI info. Additionally, under Settings \\> Local server URI , the maximum character limit is 256. Any-Order QR type under global settings To simplify the profile configuration flow for users who don't require multiple QR codes, the previous Device type for profile page has been removed and replaced with a toggle option under Settings , which provides the ability to scan QR codes in any order. This option is available for devices on Knox 3.8 or higher. For devices with a Knox version lower than 3.8, the QR codes scan in order. Additionally, under the Profiles list, a new QR Code Scan Order column shows this information at a glance. QR code size control Previously, generated QR codes occupied the whole screen when displayed on monitors. On larger external monitors, the size of the QR codes made the scanning process difficult. This release introduces the ability to resize the QR code while maintaining optimal scanning functionality. Now, the QR code can be adjusted to a minimum size of 400 by 400px up to a maximum of 600 by 600px, giving you more scanning flexibility. Support for multiple APN configurations KME Direct v1.3 also adds support for multiple APN configurations. When creating a new configuration profile, on the Mobile Network Configuration page, you can now select Add APN Configuration and add up to a maximum of 20 configurations. Home key remapping setting removal To better align KME Direct with the current Knox Service Plugin (KSP) framework, the Home key remapping setting has been removed in version 1.3. This removal prevents issues such as the Google assistance function overlapping with the Home key, which hinders normal operation. If you created a profile on an older version of KME Direct and open the profile on v1.3, the Home key setting you saved will be removed. Updated in-console links to the admin guide Previously, the KME Direct console contained hyperlinks to the general KME Direct introduction page in the Knox admin guide. Now, in-console links point towards specific pages in the admin guide. For example, Learn more about different profile types now links to Set up and configuration for IT admins. Updated profile sliding panel to be view-only To ensure a better user experience, the Profiles sliding panel has been updated to function as a view-only panel. When you open the sliding panel, the first section with the profile details is opened by default, and the Edit action is available at the bottom. If you click Edit, instead of editing directly inside the panel, you instead move to the corresponding page in the KME Direct console to edit the profile value you selected. Back to release notes",

DualDAR configuration support With the v1.4 release, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct supports enabling DualDAR upon enrollment and configuring additional DualDAR settings using Knox Service Plugin. DualDAR helps to secure data on a device through two layers of encryption. These security layers are independent and protect stored information even when the device is powered off or in an unauthenticated state. To enable DualDAR on devices, a DualDAR license is required. Contact your reseller to purchase a license. Refer to Set up and configuration for IT admins for more details. For general information about DualDAR and its benefits, refer to the DualDAR Encryption whitepaper and the DualDAR architecture documentation. Server dependency removal for configuration profiles Previously, you would create configuration profiles and generate associated XML files. The XML files would bake in server information such as the full URI and the server locality - built-in or local. As a result, configuration profiles weren't compatible if the server information differed, resulting in a dependency between configurations and servers. This server dependency is now removed, and configuration files can work with any URI and server type. Moving forward, URI information is only stored within deployment profile QR codes. Note that server settings can be edited on the Global Settings screen. Multi-certificate deployment Previously, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct only supported the upload and deployment of one root or intermediate certificate when creating an Android Enterprise profile. Now, you can add and deploy up to five certificates at once. In-console UI enhancements v1.4 also includes a number of UI and UX enhancements. Changes include: Added a common shared folder among built-in and local servers. Information entered into fields is now checked to ensure correct formatting. For example, the Local server URI for a device Configuration profile field tests for fully-formed URIs. The sliding panel now stays open after a profile is edited and changes are saved. An error message displays when an XML file or QR code fails to generate or save. Added buttons to control screen sizes.

To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Minimized single QR code Previously, the QR code creation settings on the Settings dialog required you to scan multiple QR codes for every device enrollment, and supported these settings only on devices running Knox 3.8 or higher, possibly leading to enrollment failures. With the 1.6 release, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct remedies these limitations by allowing you to generate only a minimized single QR code that contains your Wi-Fi configurations and a URL for retrieving the enrollment data, thereby simplifying the enrollment process. Furthermore, you can also choose the order in which QR codes are scanned: Multiple QR codes in order (Android 11 or higher, Knox 3.7 or higher), Multiple QR codes in any order (Android 12 or higher, Knox 3.8 or higher), Minimized single QR code (Android 13 or higher, Knox 3.9 or higher) Option to leave system apps enabled Previously, most system apps were disabled, limiting usage only to some system apps such as My Files, Contacts, and Google Play Store. With the 1.6 release, system apps are disabled by default but you can now leave all system apps enabled. Doing so makes all the pre-installed system apps on the device available for use. To enable this setting for device deployment profiles, select Leave all system apps enabled on the Additional deployment options screen. The sliding panel also reflects these new settings.

Disable captive portal detection Previously, during enrollment for fully managed devices, if the device was connected to a network using a private SIM card, it couldn't validate with the servers, causing enrollment to fail. With the 1.7 release, devices running Android 14 or higher with Knox 3.10 can use the captive portal mode in device deployment profiles to disable the detection of captive portals and, therefore, skip network validation. Moreover, you can set the captive portal mode to function in one of the two following ways: Don't attempt to detect captive portals - Captive portals are ignored during enrollment. Used for Android Enterprise enrollment in closed networks by default. If detected, prompts the user to sign in - When a captive portal is detected, a notification prompts the device user to sign in. To apply this feature, the device user must reboot their device, then scan the enrollment QR code using a plus sign (+) gesture again. Self-update of the Knox Enrollment Service agent within closed network Starting with the 1.7 release, you can now update the Knox Enrollment Service agent from the locally-hosted relay server within closed network environments. This update behavior means that new features that are intended only for newer Knox Enrollment Service agent versions are available whenever a new version of the Knox Enrollment Service agent is released, without the need to wait for device OS updates. Expert mode in device configuration With the 1.7 release, you can now create device configuration profiles in Expert mode, which allows you to directly extract, configure, and upload the device configuration XML file derived from the Knox Service Plugin schema. The Expert mode relies on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to unpack the Knox Service Plugin APK file and extract the device configuration XML file. Hence, if JRE 1.8 isn't installed, a dialog informs you that Java is necessary for the Expert mode functionality. Back to release notes",

There may be circumstances when the screen appears overly populated with values that may not be important to you. Use the filter options to just select those needed column values and select Save Changes. Once saved, the updated display settings are committed locally, and are available upon subsequent logins as long as the local system cache is not refreshed. New Knox Deployment App (KDA) with Bluetooth enrollment support To support Bluetooth enrollment, an IT admin installs the KDA on a dedicated admin device and selects configuration profiles. A device user can trigger Bluetooth enrollment by booting or factory resetting the device. If the user's device is within proximity of the admin's device, the user device connects to the admin device wirelessly via Bluetooth without a PIN or password requirement. The user enrolls using the profiles defined on the admin device. For more information, refer to the Knox Developers APP (KDA) User Guide. With the new KDA in the Play Store, IT Admins will no longer be able to add user credentials for automated sign-up to EMMs. To locate the KDA within the Play Store, search for _Knox Deployment_.

Assign preloaded application as home activity This feature enables an IT admin to define a preloaded application, including Samsung Browser, as a device kiosk mode home activity. ProKiosk mode requires the home activity support and run only one application. From the Home & Lock screen's Home activity drop down menu, select the + Add a pre-installed application option. The resulting pop-up allows a user to enter a valid package name in the input field. Once submitted, the provided application is available for selection within the Home activity drop-down menu. KLM license addition permitted prior to SLM activation date To date, only active KLM keys could be added within the Knox Configure console. Consequently, inactive KLM keys could not be added and registered to a KC server before their activation date. To satisfy both internal and external customer requests, an IT admin can now add a new KLM license (but not an inactive license) before its actual SLM activation date, enabling the admin to optimally register the license and assign a profile and devices before the license's activation date. A pop-up warning message displays stating the activation date for the license key has not yet started. Enhanced keyboard settings in ProKiosk mode With this enhancement, an IT admin can customize a ProKiosk device's keyboard settings by turning On/Off predictive mode or enabling/disabling keyboard settings. The Predictive mode setting and Keyboard settings options function independent from one another, so there are no constraints on using these options together. Related API options are available within the Knox Customization SDK. Emergency call button available To date, when a device lock is applied, there was no option but to make a call to the number predefined by an IT admin. This posed a significant problem for users in an emergency, since they may not be able to reach out to the appropriate emergency responder. The new EMERGENCY CALL button provides a means of contacting a default emergency resource when the device PIN cannot be provided and the device unlocked. The contact used for the emergency call must be added within Contacts > ICE > emergency contacts > EDIT. KC console enhancements The following Knox Configure portal enhancements are included in DS 1.8: Within the portal's Device connectivity profile setting, the Hide notifications when open networks are detected checkbox option is removed in Knox versions 2.9 and above, as setWifiNetworkNotificationState is deprecated in the Knox 2.9 cSDK. A tooltip is available within the Enterprise Billing UX to inform an admin that only a single APN resource is available at a one time. The portal's Enable SIM lock feature has a new tooltip and User Guide update to reduce confusion: \"Enabling this feature will prevent the use of a corporate SIM card on any other device. Whenever the corporate device is powered on, it automatically unlocks the SIM card for that session. However, if the SIM card is moved to another device, it remains locked. The IT administrator can set a PIN here to unlock the SIM card for use on a different device.\" , The portal's Profiles table and its supporting column titles have become too crowded in some locations and languages. To remedy, column titles are shorter in some Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.). Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #KME feedback form enhancements The KME portal's feedback form is improved to better emphasize its intention as a general product feedback forum, and not a mechanism to submit bugs and issues. Additionally, a link has been added to submit KME portal bugs and issues directly to the Knox Support team. #Do profile enhancements Only a single APK is supported.\"For existing DO profiles, you need to remove all but a single APK to save the KME profile. #EULA, Terms of Service and User Agreement enhancements The following enhancements are available: Changed \"Knox-related EULAs\" to \"Knox-related agreements\" , To date, the \"Enterprise License\" and \"Knox License\" links have both referred to the same Privacy Notice. To avoid confusion, both have been replaced with the correct link name, \"Samsung Knox Privacy Notice\". The \"Knox Workspace\" link has been renamed \"Knox Workspace Terms and Condition\". #Additional country support Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Taiwan were added to the list of countries and regions supporting KME. #Additional DO EMM support ManageEngine has been added to Samsung's list of EMMs supporting Google device owner (DO). DO is a privilege assigned to a EMM to apply policies and restrictions to a device during setup. Reseller Portal #Reseller portal UX updates With the DS 1.8 Reseller Portal release, the CUSTOMERS > Uploads screen has new columns for total uploaded devices and total number of registered valid devices. The number of Registered devices displays as a link that be selected to review registered device information in detail. Additionally, the CUSTOMERS > Devices tab no longer displays failed devices, as non-active device information is no longer sent to the portal interface. #Device verification improvements Rejected devices no longer display within the Reseller Portal's device table. Rejected devices now only display within a reject event-generated CSV error message. Back to release notes",

Improvements for adding shortcuts and widgets from home screen To date, the Home screen index started from 0 in Galaxy S8 and later model devices. With other models, if the zero page is disabled, the home screen starts from 0. However, if the zero page is enabled, the home screen starts from 1. To remedy this situation, the home screen index is adjusted for better consistency for both shortcuts and widgets, regardless of the presence of a Zeropage. Secondary admin permission enhancements To date, device deletions and profile un-assignments have had a significant impact to device management. Consequently, primary admins should be able to restrict secondary admin capability. With this enhancement, a primary admin can manage a secondary admin's permissions for device deletions and profile un-assignments at any time from the \"Manage Administrators\" page. To avoid impacts to existing customers, these two permissions are enabled by default. The menu options are greyed out if a secondary admin does not have adequate permissions for device deletions or profile un-assignments. Enable Bluetooth discoverable mode within Knox Configure console Currently, there is no on/off setting in the Knox Configure portal for Bluetooth discoverable mode, only a means to either enable or disable Bluetooth. Discoverable mode is a Bluetooth device state that enables Bluetooth devices to search, connect and transfer data amongst other Discoverable mode enables Bluetooth devices. The addition of Bluetooth discoverable mode with this release is just for Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles in either Normal or Kiosk mode. If an IT admin disables Bluetooth discoverable mode, the discoverable mode remains off even if the device end user enables Bluetooth on their device. If an IT admin wants to turn on Bluetooth discoverable mode on an end user's device, they uncheck the Disable Bluetooth discoverable mode option in Knox Configure. Once enabled in Knox Configure, discoverable mode remains on, even if the end user turns off Bluetooth on their device. Dynamic EE profile distinction To date, there is no parameter to differentiate Enterprise Edition profiles within the Knox Deployment App. To resolve this confusion, the Knox Deployment App now correctly lists Setup, Dynamic or Dynamic EE as the profile type to better categorize profile types. Feedback page optimizations Currently, the Knox Configure Feedback form is frequently used by customers to report technical issues with the portal, as opposed to a form for general feedback to improve their Knox Configure portal experience. To resolve this issue, links were added into the Feedback form to route customers to the proper Support resources for filing a ticket. This update keeps the feedback form dedicated to portal improvements and not a resource for filing and escalating individual customer support issues. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Push updates available without pressing FINISH or RESTART A wearable device profile push can be completed by the user pushing Finish or after a 5-second timer expiration. With this DS 1.9 release, the FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a new 5-second timer under them to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input after the 5-second countdown, the wearable device screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. This feature reduces the labor required with large deployment profile pushes, where the FINISH or RESTART button must be selected on each wearable device. #Enrollment enhancements This enhancement addresses our IT admins' request to have the end user complete enrollment without touching a wearable device's \"FINISH\" or \"RESTART\" button. To satisfy this request, the wearable device's FINISH button remains as it is today, but a new 5-second timer displays under it. If there is no input from user for 5 seconds, the device automatically moves to its home screen. In ProKiosk mode, a message will display stating the wearable device will restart in 5 seconds, then reboot automatically. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #Device Owner (DO) profile utilization message enhancements If DO selected for a profile, the Associate a Knox license with this profile option is disabled. Similarly, if Associate a Knox license with this profile is selected, then the DO checkbox is disabled. If the user attempts to save a legacy profile and DO is set with a License Key, then an Unable to save. Google Device Owner does not support a Knox license. Please remove the license and try again error message displays. #Simplified KME + DO on-device experience Currently, the Google Welcome screen and KME Welcome screen appear duplicated. With this new flow enhancement, KME will not show the welcome screen and reuse the Google screen since it cannot be removed.

Push updates now available for selected devices To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration profile, each device utilizing this specific profile receives the configuration update, whether intended or not. With this enhancement, an IT admin can select individual devices for push updates from the portal's PROFILES tab or at the time of profile modification. This helps admins update just those specific devices intended for an update, and exclude those devices that are not. Added support for activity name when adding shortcuts To date, KC permits only the package name for an application shortcut, but some apps, like contacts, include several activities and appear as independent apps to device users. With this release, support is now available for providing an activity name when creating a shortcut. The KC agent will fail however if the shortcut is provided as just an activity name, since the client validates the entire package name string (for example, `com.samsung.android.contacts/com.android.dialer.DialtactsActivity`). As an interim solution, the KC agent checks if an activity name exists before passing it as package. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Profile assignment enhancements To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration, each device utilizing the updated profile receive the configuration update, whether intended or not. With this enhancement, an IT admin can select individual devices for push updates from the portal's PROFILES tab or at the time of profile modification. This helps admins update just those specific devices intended to receive a specific update and exclude those devices that do not. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #Cancel setting in profile respected after factory reset Prior to this release, a user was not able to cancel enrollment after the device was factory reset, despite what was set in the profile. Now, the cancel profile setting is respected even though the device has been factory reset. Reseller Portal #Bulk device deletions now capped at 1,000 per single delete operation To date, the Reseller Portal permits bulk device deletions up to 10,000 at a time. However, when several tens of thousands of devices are bulk deleted, errors messages can be thrown, spawning multiple threads. To reduce the potential for errors, bulk device deletes cannot exceed 1,000 for any single delete operation. Back to release notes",

Bulk device configuration enhancements using CSV This enhancement permits numerous bulk configuration operations within the KC console using a CSV file. Bulk configuration operations include assigning and un-assigning profiles, device deletions, locking devices, unlocking devices, and adding tags. To bulk configure devices, navigate to DEVICES and select BULK ACTIONS. Follow the directions on the right-hand side of the screen for preparing a CSV file with one device ID per row then add the CSV file into the portal. Profile un-assignment change for locked or ProKiosk mode devices In response to requests from both our internal and external user communities, this enhancement enables a Locked or ProKiosk mode device to remain in its current locked state or kiosk mode, even after the device profile is unassigned. To date, when a profile is unassigned from a locked or kiosk mode device, the locked state or Kiosk mode is released. Removed model dependency from profile The Model field has been removed from profiles. Therefore, one profile can be assigned to different models types and users do not have to create a separate profile for each model. This also enables future profile enhancements such as \"auto-profile-assignment\". Push updates available for selected devices in DEVICES tab To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration profile, all devices or selected devices assigned to that profile can receive the configuration update. With this enhancement, an IT admin can select individual devices for push updates from the portal's DEVICES tab. This helps admins update just those specific devices intended for an update, and exclude those devices that are not. Guaranteed push update delivery To date, KC has not been able to guarantee the delivery of a push notification to devices. Additionally, if a device does not receive push notification message for a few weeks, for reasons such as a power-off, or no network availability, it is discarded. To remedy this issue, additional logic has been added to resend a push notification when an \"Updates pushed\" status has not been changed for an extended time. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Push updates available for selected wearable devices To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration profile, each wearable device utilizing this specific profile receives the configuration update, whether intended or not. With this enhancement, an IT admin can select individual wearable devices for push updates from the portal's PROFILES tab or at the time of profile modification. This helps admins update just those specific wearable devices intended for an update, and exclude those wearable devices that are not. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #Compliance updates The following compliance related enhancements are available in this release: The Privacy Policy text describing how Samsung uses personal data is now more descriptive and supplies a link to , The KME Terms & Conditions has been updated to remove portions of the Privacy Policy relating to the consent to use data. #Email address no longer required for support resource during enrollment An email address is no longer required as a device user's support contact when enrolling the device. Going forward, just a single contact phone number can be used as a contact resource. #Added Microsoft Intune MDM support With this release, KME is supported by Microsoft's Intune EMM solution.

KME+DO with KC support added KME added support for Android Enterprise managed device mode in Knox 2.8 (on S8 and higher device platforms). Additionally, Samsung has now completed work for supporting KC + KME + Android Enterprise Managed device mode to increase opportunities for KC. KC can be launched from a KME enrolled device, by either selecting the device's back key, or from a displayed device notification (as illustrated below). When using KME with Knox Configure, be careful when unchecking the Leave all system apps enabled checkbox, as this may lead to conflicts with Knox Configure. For example, when setting the Samsung browser homepage, the Knox Configure policy will fail [51010] if system apps are disabled (since system apps include the Samsung browser). Frictionless customization Currently, when an error occurs during device enrollment, the enrollment process stops, regardless of the error type, and a failure is reported to the KC server. The current messaging is often inadequate to properly define the scope and severity of the issue that is stopping enrollment. This implementation of this feature enables an IT admin to better distinguish and categorize enrollment errors and warning messages. Enrollment now continues when a warning occurs, but stops when an error occurs. The Device log now has better descriptions and links to specific warnings and error conditions. Improved device screen grid definition Currently, the Home screen grid options do not provide enough customer preferred choices. As a result, new 4x6 and 5x6 options have been included to provide administrators a better selection for a growing set of supported device models, such as the new GalaxyS9+ . Additionally, the grid selection drop-down menu has been moved into the Device screen preview field for better logical placement of the grid selection option. ProKiosk mode enhancements To date, when Knox Configure updates a device and the device's ProKiosk mode has already been set by a customized app other than Knox Configure, a failure occurs regardless of the normal or ProKiosk mode profile type. However, if a normal mode profile is used, the Knox Configure update can be completed without a conflict with ProKiosk mode. To remedy this situation, a Knox Configure normal mode profile is now compatible with ProKiosk mode using a customized app with cSDK without a failure. License key enhancements To date, a license can be entered only if the Knox Configure License name is unique to all customers. However, there is no way for a user to know if name is truly unique across all customer deployments. To remedy this problem, the License name duplicate check logic has been revised from all customer deployments to an individual customer's pool of licenses. Second APN resource with the same parameters now permitted To satisfy a customer request, a second APN resource with the same APN resource parameters (name, apn, mcc, etc), can now be configured and entered within the Knox Configure console. While adding multiple identical APN resources has been supported on the device-side for some time, it is only with this current release that an identical APN resource can be defined and made available within the KC console. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Background push updates now permitted This enhancement enables an IT admin or system integrator to push an updated profile or application to Samsung Gear wearable devices without any related UI displaying on the target device. This enables the wearable device user to continue to use their device without interruption, as profile or application updates occur in the background. #Frictionless customization Currently, when an error occurs during wearable device enrollment, the enrollment process stops, regardless of the error type, and a failure is reported to KC server. Additionally, the current messaging is inadequate to properly define the scope and severity of the problem that halted enrollment. This implementation of this feature enables IT admin to better distinguish and categorize errors and occurs. The device log also better describes the warning or error condition encountered. #Watch face alteration and deletion prevention This feature addresses requests by IT admins who need a dynamic profile restriction policy option that prevents wearable device users from changing their device's watch face, once it is configured and set on the device. #Disallow application uninstall This feature enables an IT admin to configure a list of applications that cannot be uninstalled by the device user post enrollment and deployment. Removing an application from the disallow uninstall app list removes the uninstall restriction, and provides the device user the capability to remove the application from their device. If utilizing a setup edition profile, just a single application is permitted in the uninstall prevention list. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #KME+DO with KC support added KME added support for Android Enterprise managed device mode in Knox 2.8 (on S8 and higher device platforms). Additionally, Samsung has now completed work for supporting KC + KME + Android Enterprise Managed device mode to increase opportunities for KC. KC can be launched from a KME enrolled device, by either selecting the device's back key, or from a displayed device notification (as illustrated below). When using KME with Knox Configure, be careful when unchecking the Leave all system apps enabled checkbox, as this may lead to conflicts with Knox Configure. For example, when setting the Samsung browser homepage, the Knox Configure policy will fail [51010] if system apps are disabled (since system apps include the Samsung browser). #IBM MaaS360 DO support for KME added IBM MaaS360 now has Google DO (Work Managed Device) support for KME. IBM has provided Samsung the JSON data they provide Google for DO provisioning. `` The characters highlighted in red above are new JSON attributes IBM wants to include with their DO support. IBM are using a two-letter key/value with a 500 JSON string character limit. #MDM support for Citrix DO added With this release, Samsung has included Citrix DO (Work Managed Device) support within the KME DO drop-down menu. The following is a sample JSON: ```json } ``` #Activity log now displays and filters devices enrolled with NFC or The following reseller portal improvements are available with this release: Bluetooth To date, IT admins have been unable to see devices in the KME activity log that were added using NFC or Bluetooth. With this release, both NFC and Bluetooth enrolled devices can viewed and separately filtered within the activity log's Event column, along with those devices added into KME using a typical KME console enrollment. Reseller Portal #Improved MPTS performance The following reseller portal improvements are available with this release: Currently, the reseller portal processes uploads asynchronously. To reduce processing time, messaging for small uploads is bypassed and are processed immediately, reducing the number of messages in the queue and quickening message processing. The reseller portal sends multiple batch IDs to the MPTS script. To date, there is a 30 second delay added for MPTS processing of each batch. This delay is eliminated by using MPTS scripts to accept multiple batches. The MPTS delay has been reduced from 30 seconds to 5 seconds. Another API has been added to the reseller portal to take multiple batch IDs and return device details to the MPTS script. The MPTS script has been modified to call the newly added API and process the batches in a multi-threaded manner. The reseller portal has added multi-threading while claiming upload events. This ensures 1-2 large uploads do not hold up the queue and add latency to other uploads. Back to release notes",

Device-side UX refresh To date, numerous Knox Configure device screens have yet to improve from their legacy KCC design. To address this, the Knox Configure out-of-box device experience has a simpler flow and user navigation, reducing the number of screens a user encounters when setting up their device. Additionally, the new UX provides detailed feedback of a device's configuration progress for a better understanding of the steps involved and wait times, including app download and installation progress, and filename and download progress. Enhanced CSV profile configuration To date, IT admins are unable to optimally input configuration settings using the CSV file format. With this new feature, multiple inputs can now be provided with a CSV file or copy & paste, including: _Setup edition_ : Disable the use of other applications (Max 10) within the Applications & content section _Dynamic edition_ : Disable the use of other applications, prevent applications from being uninstalled, application restrictions (applications blocklist, applications allowlist), application URL restrictions (applications, URL blocklist, URL allowlist) within the Applications & content section APN selection for E-Billing improvements To date, the APN, MNC and MCC were not distinguishable when selecting an AP resource for a profile's E-Billing configuration.

Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #KME console UX refresh The Samsung Knox team is introducing a new version of the Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) console to provide optimal uniformity amongst our growing family of enrollment and configuration solutions. The central update is the introduction of a collapsible left-hand navigation menu, replacing the previous horizontal menu bar. This provides a visual-hierarchy of key enrollment and configuration console activities and administrator \"call-to-actions.\" The new KME console is personalized, with improved status updates from a user's previous login. Colorized status indicators optimally display \"at-a-glance\" event severity for best in class efficiency. #New deployment trigger A new device trigger was introduced in Knox 3.2 to streamline an enterprise device deployment when using Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) or Knox Configure (KC) with Galaxy Note 9 and Tab S4 devices. The new deployment trigger allows an out-of-the-box (OOB) device to be deployed (enrolled/configured) without first being uploaded by a reseller, and without the user invoking the setup wizard. To date, an out-of-box device that was not first uploaded by a reseller could only be deployed using the Knox Deployment App (KDA) running on a primary device, but the user would first have to navigate through the setup wizard. With this release, a simple plus sign (+) gesture on the target device's Welcome screen starts the out-of-box deployment directly, bypassing the setup wizard and saving time. The target device needs to be first connected to the primary device running KDA via NFC or Bluetooth. To further simplify things, Wi-Fi credentials can optionally be passed from the primary device to the target device. #Customizable screen column display The columns within the All Devices screen can be filtered to display some or all nine of the columns available. Use the Customizable Table drop-down menu, invoked on the right-hand side of the column display, to de-select those columns you would like removed from the display. Use the filter options to select just those needed column values and select Save Changes.

Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #WiFi direct available as an additional KDA enrollment option This release introduces a new enrollment option in addition to the existing KDA Bluetooth and NFC options. Wi-Fi direct supported devices can connect directly to one another via a WLAN without joining a traditional wireless network or Wi-Fi\u00ae hotspot. Once enabled, the device automatically scans for other supported Wi-Fi direct devices. Once discovered, specific devices can be selected for enrollment data transfers. With Wi-Fi direct, only out-of box trigger deployments are supported. Trigger deployments utilize a plus sign (+) gesture on a device's Welcome screen to start an out-of-box deployment and bypass the setup wizard. To utilize the Wi-Fi direct option, the receiver device must be utilizing Knox version 3.2 or above. Additionally, only Note9 and Tab S4 and above devices are supported. Wi-Fi direct is not supported on wearable devices. #Profile UI updated to accommodate DO changes To accommodate DO enhancements within KME, several console changes are required in respect to how Customer Support information is managed. Beginning with this release, when a profile created and customer support info added, a popup indicates the emulator display is for instances when DO is _not_ selected, but the display will be different if the Enable this app as a Google Device Owner option is selected. Currently, if a DO enabled profile is created, only the Customer name displays within the Add profile details screen and descriptive text disappears, potentially confusing customers. To remedy this situation, helpful information remains displayed to reduce uncertainty when proceeding with the DO profile configuration. Additionally, when a DO supported profile is created and the profile's Customer Support Info is edited, only the customer name is editable. Remaining support information (address, email, phone) is greyed out, and descriptive text displays explaining these greyed out parameters are not supported with a DO profile. #Bulk profile clear option now available To date, admins were unable to bulk clear profiles from their list of uploaded devices. To address this shortcoming, a Clear profiles option has been added to existing bulk profile configuration operations within the KME console. Back to release notes",

Role based access control (RBAC) improvements This release introduces a new _Role Based Access Control_ (RBAC) capability that allows customer (tenant) admins who are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KME utilizes admin roles unique to that service, a Super Admin cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically with the next Knox Cloud Service release in Q1 2019. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available. Different customer support information now available for each profile To date, tenants can only use a single set of customer support information, regardless of the need to provide different support information to different profiles and users. Consequently, each end-user sees the same support content, even though the new KCS Customer API now supports different customer support information per profile. With this release, when a profile is initially created an Admin is now prompted to input support contact information that can either be used across all profiles by default or just used with this one new profile. Existing customers can also be migrated to current Customer Support Info that then becomes the Default support information accessed in the top right hand menu. Additionally, an admin can edit the contact information within just that individual profile. The admin can also edit the Default support information, and have it available to new profiles upon creation, with no update made to existing profiles. Knox Cloud Services on same device, device deletion concept This feature introduces a new device deletion concept when KME is utilized with other Knox Cloud Services. If a device is only used with KME, its removal is a typical hard deletion, and the device is removed from both KME and the Reseller Portal. However, if a device is used with both KME and another Knox Cloud service, like Knox Configure (KC), it is deleted from KME only (soft deletion), and remains in KC. Back to release notes",

Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #Limitation added to administrator invitation roles To avoid the further escalation of Knox Mobile Enrollment administrative roles and permissions issues, an existing admin who does not have a Manage roles permission requires additional restrictions regarding the roles they can assign to other administrators. With this release, existing administrators without a Manage role permission can only invite admins with a matching set of their own role permissions. As a result, the Invite administrator screen's Role drop-down menu choices were customized for the particular role of the admin creating the invitation. #View only administrator permission added This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator view only permissions. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. When a View only radio button is not selected, all nested options under that category (Profiles, Resellers etc.) are disabled. Additionally, if a radio button has nested options and that category has View only selected, at least one of its permission checkboxes must also be selected. New roles have View only enabled by default. Existing roles that inherit the new View only permission have it turned off by default to prevent issues. Manage tags and Manage device users have also been added as additional KME permissions. #Limit access to Knox Mobile Enrollment web portal With this new permission, you can now create a role that can only access KME via the Knox Deployment Application, and not via the web portal.

Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #FAMOC MDM DO support FAMOC now has Android Enterprise Device Owner mode (Fully Managed Device) support for KME. #Admins now capable of being invited to multiple services To date, an admin is unable to invite another admin belonging to a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or an admin with Admins' permission can now invite an admin belonging to a different service to a role in their service. For example, Admin 1 belongs to just KC with a non-Super Admin role. Admin 2 belongs to KME with a non-Super Admin role, but has Admins' permissions. Therefore, Admin 2 can invite Admin 1 to join KME for any role for which Admin 2 has permissions. #KDA only access permission added This feature addresses IT admin requests to only use the Knox Deployment App (KDA) for enrollments, and not access any of the KCS portal resources (including the KME console). When relying exclusively on the KDA without the KME console, an admin must login into the KDA, choose a service (KC, KME, etc.), select a profile, pair the primary/admin device with a target device, and then assign the profile to the target device. Additionally, a KDA access permission option is added into the KME Create role screen to provide administrators the ability to grant permission to enroll devices directly into KME using the KDA. #Knox Deployment Application (KDA) v1.2.25 released to Google Play Store The Knox Deployment Application v.1.2.25 is now available from the Google Play Store.

Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #Improved KME onboarding for new customers To better align with KC, and reduce the upfront enrollment complexity for new customers, a new user interface has been implemented that replaces the existing setup wizard new customers experience. This streamlined onboarding navigation flow includes screens for adding devices, creating profiles, and assigning and enrolling devices. #Activity log events added for administrative roles With this release, the activity log has been enhanced to provide a broader range of administrator role event changes. These administration and role events included in the activity log include the following: Administrator invitations, Administrator logins, Administrator modifications, Re-sent, reactivated, or revoked invitations, Blocked administrators, Added, modified, and deleted roles. #Migrate existing profiles to either a DA or DO specific profiles KME profile creation has become more complex as new DO options - partner drop-down, Knox License, and so on - were introduced. As DO options have become increasingly different from DA options, including them both in a single UX flow become unnecessarily cumbersome. To resolve this issue, an admin can now specify whether they want to uniquely configure a _Device Owner_ (DO) or _Device Admin_ (DA) supported profile. Once selected, the subsequent screen flow navigation is specific to either the DO or DA profile type selected. This enhancement allows admins to configure a profile with greater efficiency with no confusion about whether any configuration items are required to configure their intended DO or DA profile. #View only administrative permissions added This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator view only permissions.

Create a dynamic APK URL link based on Google Managed Play Admins have requested an easier and more reliable way to retrieve a MDM APK for DO profile utilization, rather than having to manually navigate to the APK, then enter the correct path to its location. With this release, MDMs with APKs available at Google Managed Play can be selected, and their URLs populated dynamically. If Other is selected from the MDM drop-down menu the APK field remains editable. When a supported DO is selected, a URL text box displays with the correct MDM APK URL, and a green checkmark lets the admin know the APK validation is successful. Alternatively, an error message displays if the selected MDM's APK URL could not be parsed. Only tested and functional MDM APKs are available for selection. Activity log updates for administrative role events With this release the KME activity log now provides better event status for administrative role updates. The following updates are now included: Administrator invitations, Admin info edits, Revoked invitations, Resent invitations for revoked admins (Resent invitations for pending admins are not logged), Deactivated accounts, Reactivated accounts Role deletions permitted for pending, revoked, and locked admin states This enhancement provides admins the ability to delete a role with a pending, revoked or blocked state. Before the role can be deleted, a Delete role screen lists the role's current administrator assignments. The deletion is not allowed if there are active users assigned to the role. These users must be assigned a different role to permit the deletion. A Delete role popup message also displays when a role re-assignment is required for a deletion. Secure pass of user-credentials during device assignment API call This enhancement addresses admin requests for a secure means to pass user-credentials during a device assignment API call. With this release, the Samsung Knox team provides a means for customers to encrypt user-credentials (username and password) before they are passed in an Assign Profile API call. The user credentials are then decrypted for device enrollment. Tooltip added for reseller deletions To date, when an admin cannot delete a reseller due to the reseller's associated devices the Delete button is disabled, and the admin could be wondering why the delete function is inoperable. To remedy this situation, a tooltip now displays when hovering over the Delete button. The tooltip clearly states the reseller cannot be removed as long as it's associated with devices utilized by a Knox Cloud Service. KME satisfaction survey The Knox Mobile Enrollment Survey was designed by the Knox team to better understand what users require from the KME service. With this latest KCS release, users will be notified of the survey's availability. The questions are designed to gauge customer needs in respect to company size and deployment requirements.

Enhanced auto-assignment capability This feature addresses customer requests to have multiple auto-assignment rules per reseller, rather than the single one currently available. This is done by the customer creating a profile alias which is shared with the reseller and can be used by the reseller when uploading devices. Once created, the reseller can attach the profile alias to an upload which the customer in turn uses for a profile auto-assignment rule. However, the reseller must be sure which alias to use per upload, so this feature should only be used when a reseller has coordinated with the customer regarding which profile alias to use. Profile aliases are not shared across resellers, so they are not unique across resellers but unique per reseller. There can be up to 10 profile aliases per reseller, but a profile alias can only be associated with a single profile. Try to keep the alias somewhat simple and easy to remember. Profile aliases are not required, and it is up to the reseller to optionally use. However, when created, an alias must be associated with an existing profile. Devices are auto-assigned the profile selected by the reseller via the associated profile alias. If a reseller decides to not use a profile alias, then the uploaded devices will be assigned to the default profile (if one exists) or be unassigned (if no default profile has been created for the reseller). A profile alias displays as a tag within the KME console and cannot be removed unless the device is deleted, assigned another profile, or the profile is removed. The Device details screen also displays an alias as a tag and whether the profile has been auto-assigned. Existing profile auto-assignment rules will not be changed, but additional rules can be added via profile aliases. Blocked or revoked admins no longer display by default To avoid a cluttered display, KME admins do not always want to see blocked or revoked admins within the Administrators & Roles screen. However, blocked (deactivated) and revoked admins are currently always displayed in the list of admins with no option to filter them out. To remedy this issue, blocked and revoked admins no longer display by default within the admin list. Blocked and revoked admins can be displayed at any time by enabling the Show blocked and revoked administrators checkbox. The selection of the checkboxes is persistent when logging in or out of the KME console.

QR code enrollment (Android 10 devices only) This release introduces QR code enrollment as a fourth device-side enrollment option for Android 10 devices in addition to existing Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi Direct options. A QR code is a unique matrix barcode containing information about the item to which the QR code is attached. The QR code enrollment process begins with a device plus-sign (+) gesture that activates the device's camera in QR code recognition mode. Once a QR code is recognized, a Wi-Fi connection is made and enrollment begins. If there are no Wi-Fi credentials within the QR-code, then the device user is prompted to provide them, as these are the Wi-Fi connection credentials used during device enrollment in Device Owner (DO) mode. The QR code profile configuration is defined within the KME console's Device Owner profile settings screen by selecting the ADD QR CODE button that is only available for Android 10 devices. By default, the QR code is only used for devices uploaded by resellers. However, there is an option for other non-reseller uploads as well to reduce the dependency of reseller involvement and the use of the _Knox Deployment App_ (KDA). If adding a Wi-Fi network configuration to the QR code, define the security option as either None, WEP, or WPA/WPA2. The QR code contains the profile ID, country, and an optional Wi-Fi SSID and password, all in a non-encrypted JSON format. Consequently, QR codes should only be shared with trusted admins. The Samsung Knox team recommends enabling wireless isolation on the network's access point or router resource when adding a Wi-Fi configuration to a QR code. Enabling wireless isolation restricts a wireless computer from accessing other computers connected to the local network, effectively isolating that device on the network. The means to enable wireless isolation differs depending on the router or access point manufacturer. Refer to the documentation available from the manufacturer for their specific instructions on enabling wireless isolation. Once all the mandatory fields are populated, select ADD to include the QR code with the profile. The QR code is generated once the profile is created. Search option added to role column filter within Administrator & Roles screen To date the KME console's Administrators & Roles screen did not have a filter and sort option within the screen's Role column. The Knox Configure console has this filter option, so it's important for customers that this filter option be available within the KME console as well.

Existing administrators assigned to the target role must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. Display non-randomized Wi-Fi MAC address This enhancement addresses KME customer requests to allowlist a device Wi-Fi address and have MPTS return the device's non-randomized Wi-Fi MAC address (the mobile device MAC) so it can be stored in the database and displayed via the KME portal using a properly formatted CSV file. Going forward, a mobile device's Wi-Fi MAC address will receive greater visibility by displaying in the following locations: Device screen (additional column display option) Device details screen CSV file Permit QR code enrollment using non-randomized MAC address This enhancement addresses admin requests for QR code enrollment (with Wi-Fi JSON data) using the device's non-randomized MAC address, so the device can enroll more securely. Such customers need to allow device IMEIs to connect to their Wi-Fi network while enrolling. The MAC address is available via MPTS, but the device also needs to automatically use the MAC address when connecting to Wi-Fi. To support this request, a new checkbox option has been added within the Add QR code and QR code for this profile screens to include the device's MAC address within QR code's Wi-Fi configuration data. The MAC address will now also display within the device details pop-screen as an additional device MAC address reference point. Added QR code icon to profile table To date, there is no ideal way to launch and review QR code details from the existing MDM Profiles screen. This resulted in reported confusion regarding which listed profiles contain a QR code. To resolve this issue, a QR code icon now displays directly to the right of those profiles names that have a QR code configuration defined. Selecting the icon displays the QR code for this profile screen, where the QR code configuration can be reviewed and potentially modified. Additionally, the user is able to download and print the QR code as needed. Console search hints added to reduce search uncertainty To date, there is no way to clearly know which fields within the KME console are searchable for specific parameters within any given screen, resulting in reported uncertainty as to what data can be included in console screen searches. To remedy this uncertainty, the Search field is now longer to optimize free space within the console and include more search string data. Going forward, the following search string hints display within each listed screen: _UPLOADS_, Search by Reseller name, _DEVICES/UPLOAD DETAIL PAGE_ - Search by Device ID, Profile, Model, Tags, _PROFILE_, Search by Profile name, _ADMINISTRATORS_, Search by Administrator name, E-mail, Role, _ROLES_ - Search by Role name, _ACTIVITY LOG - _ Search by Name, Event, _DEVICE USERS -_ Search by User Id Customer onboarding improvements To date, Knox does not support a Japanese reseller's use of Google's zero-touch common library (CreateCustomer API) to onboard customers into an EMM.

Certificates can now be downloaded and installed after KME enrollment profile creation, but prior to EMM connectivity which may require root certificates to proceed. The following certificate types are supported - .cer, .pem, .crt, .der, and .ca-bundle (either inside the ZIP file or applied directly), while .p7b, .p7s, .p12, and .pfx file types are not supported. With Android 9, root/intermediate certificates are installed in the device default keystore. With Android 10 and greater, root/intermediate certificates are installed in the VPN and App keystores, as well as the device default keystore. Customer now able to let EMM access their data using KME API This feature allows customers to authorize those EMMs who have integrated via KME APIs to access their data. The customer super admin must enter unique ID of the EMM in KME. A valid ID is associated with an EMM partner for access permission verification. Once the ID is matched, the name of the EMM displays in a success dialog to provide confirmation to the customer. Once authorized by the customer, the KME APIs can be used by their EMM to access their customer data (https://docs.samsungknox.com/devref/knox-mobile-enrollment/index.htm. If not authorized, the KME APIs cannot be used. The super admin can revoke permission at any time by deleting or editing the ID. Proget and Chimpa added to list of supported EMMs in the KME-DO dropdown list With this release, both Proget and Chimpa were added to the list of supported EMMs. Specifically, Proget and Chimpa were added to the Pick your MDM drop-down menu when selecting an EMM to assign the device owner privilege. South Korea added as a KME supported country South Korea has been added a KME supported country in the EU region. Going forward, South Korea will be available within the KME samsungknox.com drop-down during signup. Back to release notes",

Allow Work Profile (PO) creation in KME via MDM selection This feature addresses admin requests to create a KME supported PO profile (work profile) with supported MDMs. With this release, you can now choose what type of out-of-box Android Enterprise enrollment to use. Previously, KME only supported fully managed devices via Device Owner (DO) mode, but with this release KME is also supporting out-of-box work profile creation via the Profile Owner (PO) mode, as long as it is supported by the MDM. This is accomplished by adding a profile option to \"Let MDM choose\" what kind of enrollment to use. This is a new feature introduced in Android 10, and not all MDMs currently support it. When configuring Android Enterprise profile settings, an admin is now presented the option of setting MDM INFORMATION to Force Device Owner enrollment. When Force Device Owner enrollment checkbox is selected, an admin is displayed the Android Enterprise profile settings screen with settings for a DO profile. However, if the Force DO enrollment checkbox is _not_ selected the admin is displayed the Android Enterprise profile settings screen (if running Android 10 or later) to let the MDM optionally enroll as a PO (Profile Owner). Profiles created before the KCS 1.34 release are set to Force Device Owner enrollment. The default setting for any newly created profile will also have this value. For information on configuring an Android Enterprise KME profile, see Android Enterprise profiles. On-premises Intranet hosted MDM APK support Often the most time consuming parts of device enrollment is downloading the MDM APK over the public Internet. With this release you can now host and download the APK from inside your own Intranet. Besides speeding up device enrollment, you can also host private MDM APKs that are not publically available. With this release, a This MDM APK is locally hosted on an Intranet server checkbox has been added to the Android Enterprise profile details screen to provide an alternative to an externally hosted MDM agent APK. Select this option to use an APK resource from within a local company Intranet. This option is disabled by default. If the Publically available MDM APK option is selected, then a text box displays. Enter the URL of a publically accessible version of the exact same MDM APK you are hosting within your local company Intranet. By default, Samsung recommends a location based on the MDM name you may have previously selected, but this can be overwritten. If there is no publically available exact match, then select Privately available MDM APK and provide the required information associated with the Intranet hosted MDM APK. This is used for validation during device enrollment, and also to display on the Managed Provisioning screen. The Admin component name is expressed as _package name/class name_. For example, com.airwatch.androidagent/com.airwatch.agent.DeviceAdministratorReceiver for the Workspace ONE UEM. The Admin package signature checksum is the Base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the MDM APK signature, which is URL friendly. You can get this value from your MDM. Go here for information on the EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM. Alternatively, you can use utilities such as _Keytool_ on Linux to get this value. Go here\" for additional information. The MDM app name is the name of the app displayed on the Managed Provisioning screen. The App icon is the icon displayed next to the MDM app name. The minimum size is 48 x 48 pixels, and the file format needs to be a PNG file. To use this information to create an enrollment profile, see Android Enterprise profiles. What's new pop-up messaging This release introduces a pop-message with new descriptive text of the new features introduced with the KCS 1.34 release. This will help familiarize admins and users with the latest functionality to assist with enrollment and deployment. Consolidated KnoxSuite service on-boarding This feature addresses KnoxSuite admin requests to use a single consolidated onboarding process instead of separate onboarding flows for services such as KME and Knox Manage (KM). Currently, when a user selects the Try Knox Suite button, on the Knox Portal Dashboard, they must apply for a requested service separately. Samsung Admin approvals are also separate per requested service. With this release, when a service such as KM is already approved for a specific customer, that customer's KME request is also approved automatically. However, if that customer's KM onboarding request is still not approved or pending, then the KME request is not approved until the Samsung Admin approves the original KM onboarding request. This helps keep Knox Suite requests aligned and reduces confusing onboarding duplication across supported services. Back to release notes",

Language selection for gesture-based enrollment with Android 11 Unlike Android 10 enrollment and the utilization of a language selection menu, with gesture-based KDA or QR code Android 11 enrollments, you cannot select a language. To remedy this shortcoming, this release introduces a screen dedicated to selecting a language before displaying the gesture-based enrollment menu. This feature is available on select models in EU and some regions. More regions will be supported in future releases. On devices where language selection is unavailable on the first screen, users can go to the next screen to select their language. Then, they can go back to the first screen for gesture-based enrollment. SafePhone added to list of supported EMMs in the KME-DO dropdown list With this release, SafePhone was added to the list of supported EMMs. Specifically, SafePhone was added to the Pick your MDM drop-down menu when selecting an EMM to assign the device owner privilege. Updated KME logos and branding The KME console and email headers were updated to be consistent with other 2020 branding initiative updates across the Knox service product line. These updates will help provide better uniformity in the look and feel of all Knox services. Two-factor authentication will be mandatory for all IT admins using Knox Deployment App To allow the Knox Deployment App (KDA) to leverage Samsung Account's security features (like login alert, trusted device management, force logout, account activity history, and so on) two-factor authentication (2FA) will be required when logging in to KDA. A user who does not have 2FA set up will be directed to configure 2FA first. A user who logs in to KDA effectively logs in with their Samsung Account on the entire device - not just KDA. In addition, the minimum Knox version for KDA is now Knox 2.8 (Android 7.1). The following are accepted as the second form of authentication: Phone numbe, Authenticator app (such as Microsoft Authenticator, Google OTP, and so on), Verification code sent to other Galaxy devices, Backup codes The following are the user impacts: Once the user has successfully logged in, they no longer need to log in again. Once the user has set up 2FA on their account, it will also be required when they log in to SamsungKnox.com. Users using a personal Samsung Account for B2C services (for example, Samsung Health, SmartThings, and so on) will not be able to log in to KDA on the same device with their enterprise account. They will need to log out of their personal account first. For more information, see the FAQs for two-step verification. KME will not support Device Admin based enrollment on devices running Android 11 or later In accordance with Google's Device Admin (DA) deprecation plan, KME is also going to deprecate DA by blocking new DA enrollments of devices with Android 11 or later. If a device running Android 11 tries to enroll using a KME DA profile, an error message will be shown. To continue enrollment, an Android Enterprise profile, such as a Device Owner profile, should be used. For more information, see the following references: Device admin deprecation, What you need to know about Device Admin deprecation NFC enrollment will be deprecated from Android 11 The Knox Deployment App's NFC enrollment option is no longer available for devices running Android 11 or later. It was built based on Android Beam, which was deprecated by Google. The NFC option was designed to enroll devices to Knox cloud services (such as Knox Mobile Enrollment and Knox Configure) using KDA along with gesture-based out-of-the-box enrollment. For more information, see Android Beam deprecation. Pre-notice: Minimum Knox version for KME The minimum Knox platform requirement for Knox Mobile Enrollment will go up to Knox 2.6 (Android 6.0) in March 2021. Currently, it is Knox 2.4 (Android 5.0.1). KME may continue to work properly on devices with Knox 2.4 or 2.5, but it will no longer be officially tested and supported by the Knox team.

Profile management KME REST API updates The following updates were made to the Profile Management REST APIs: If `doEnabled` or `aeEnabled` is true: The `supportPhoneNumber` and `supportEmailAddress` fields are now optional. The `skipSetupWizard` field is now always true. The `allowUserCancel` field is now always false. The `supportedMDM` field is now required. A profile can have `doEnabled` or `aeEnabled` set to `true` , but not both. For reference: When `doEnabled` is true, the device is enrolled in Device Owner mode. When `aeEnabled` is true, the MDM chooses which mode to enroll the device in, whether Device Owner or Profile Owner mode. Setting up an Android Enterprise profile Previously, in the Android Enterprise profile creation screen, the Force Device Owner Enrollment option was enabled by default. Starting this release, the default option is Let MDM choose to enroll as a Device Owner or Profile Owner. In addition, all existing profiles that were saved with the Force Device Owner Enrollment option enabled have the Let MDM choose to enroll as a Device Owner or Profile Owner option enabled instead. Auto-approve and auto-assign rules for profile aliases through the KME API A new set of APIs were added to the KME REST API to make it possible to auto-approve a reseller and auto-assign a profile or profile alias. With these new APIs, a KME IT admin is now able to do the following: Auto-approve a reseller, given a reseller ID. (Optional) Auto-assign a default profile (given a profile ID) to the devices that this reseller uploads. Set an additional profile alias (a string) that this reseller can auto-assign to the devices they upload for this customer. Resolved: Access denied when downloading a CSV file Previously, a configuration change caused an Access Denied exception whenever IT admins attempted to download a CSV file from the KME admin portal (for example, to download the device list, activity log, or device users list). This issue was resolved with this release. Device details view - slide out panels In the Knox Admin Portal for both KC and KME, device details information shows in a single slide out panel. This slide out panel helps users retain visibility of the underlying page, while letting users view and edit the device's details. When users change any device information, the slide out panel offers a Save button that lets users save their changes. Back to release notes",

DualDAR option improvements KME now supports DualDAR and allows users to enable this option from the KME console's MDM Profile Setting menu. When creating a new profile for AE(DO), the DualDAR option is not selected by default since this option is tied closely to the licensing status of the account. Premium users user must manually select the DualDAR option to apply it to the devices in the profile. To use DualDAR on devices, the customer needs a premium or DualDAR license. If there is no DualDAR license available or active for the account or the device, the device is locked within 24 hours of enabling the DualDAR option. Once the device is locked, it is rendered unusable. The only way to unlock the device and make it usable is to reset the device to factory settings. API and other enhancements This release also includes the following feature enhancements and other improvements: New API to provide a list of registered resellers: This release includes a new API called Get reseller list, as a part of the Device upload and reseller management APIs. This new API lets IT admins using KME and KME APIs get a list of all active resellers, including the following information: Reseller ID , Reseller name , Reseller country , Auto-assign status , Auto-device upload approval status , List of auto-assigned profile names (to a maximum of 11 names) Any resellers with an inactive status are not included in this list. In case of customers without any registered resellers, the API results in an error message. New API to register a new reseller: This release includes a new API called Register reseller, as a part of the Device upload and reseller management APIs. This API is available for both US and EU regions, and lets IT admins register a new reseller using a new reseller ID. The reseller ID must be active, unregistered, and already existing in the DB. New notification center KME now includes a new notification center that matches the look and feel of the KC notification center. The notification center can show information items for one or more of the following items: System, Profiles, Uploads, Devices, Resellers, Activity Log, Device users, Bulk actions, Feedback, Admins To see detailed information about any item in the notification center, the user clicks the appropriate item.

Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, all notification emails from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Device Sync for various Knox services When registering devices to a customer from the Reseller Portal (RP), you cannot specify the Knox service. So, when a customer subscribes to a service, all devices registered from the RP are automatically synced to the registered services. This automatic sync results in all devices, even devices not currently in use, are uploaded to the services resulting in massive data usage. This release introduces a new feature where users can manually sync devices with the appropriate Knox service from the Knox dashboard. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal, but the devices from the Reseller Portal are not synced automatically. 2. When the user first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Show/Hide Service page shows. The user can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the user can choose to add or remove services using the Show/Hide Service buttons on the left navigation menu. 3. After selecting all services, the user clicks Confirm. The user must select at least one service; without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the user were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync was not successful, users can manually run the sync process again. Remove Samsung app auto-install features in KES client KME client has been installing Samsung Internet and Samsung Email apps (if they are not preloaded in the device) during out-of-box enrollment process to resolve errors from certain Knox APIs - for example BrowserPolicy and EmailPolicy - due to their absence in the device. These days most EMMs provide app management feature using MGP and many customers have used it. Due to the low usage of those Knox APIs and longer enrollment time caused by app download and installation, KME is deprecating the feature from this release.

In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Allow option to skip start of managed provisioning enrollment flow Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) now offers the option to skip the first step of Android Enterprise's managed provisioning enrollment flow. This allows you to skip the message that the device belongs to your organization for devices that are on Android 12 and above. The default value is checked, and you can unselect the checkbox if you prefer to follow all steps of the enrollment flow. Add new MDMs in Android Enterprise profile drop-down selection To create a KME profile, you would open the dashboard and click Create Profile. From there, you would select the Android Enterprise profile type and fill out the basic information page, which includes a drop down to pick your MDM. If you wanted one that wasn't listed on the drop-down menu, you would have to select Other and paste in your agent APK. This latest release adds two new partners in the drop-down - Headwind and Urmobo. For more information on creating profiles, see the profile configuration documentation. Remove Force DO/Let MDM choose option for profiles Prior to this release, there was a Force DO/Let MDM choose option on the Android Enterprise profile setup page. This option will be removed and all profiles will now work as Let MDM choose (DO or WP-C) as the default and mandatory choice. This change streamlines the process, and will cover all customer use cases. Note that all existing profiles will be automatically changed to this option. Set Disable System app as default value for Profile settings menu Instead of presenting options to set either Leave all system apps enabled or Disable System Applications on the Android Enterprise profile settings screen, the default value is now set to the latter.

In the case of company-owned devices with a work profile, the Knox Asset Intelligence agent is installed in the work profile. To automatically install the Knox Asset Intelligence app during OOBE enrollment: 1. Ask your reseller to upload the devices under your customer ID through the Knox Deployment Program. 2. On the Knox Asset Intelligence console, approve the devices so their statuses change from Pending to Not enrolled. 3. Complete the KME enrollment process and setup wizard, along with any other Knox services applicable. The automatic installation of the Knox Asset Intelligence agent starts after you finish enrolling in all other services. For more information, see the enrollment order of multiple Knox services. 4. Wait for the device to start downloading the latest version of the app. The download and enrollment progress bars are shown as device notification items. 5. The agent asks for consent to access the device's location data. If your enterprise requires access to the device's location data, grant the permission. 6. Click Continue to finish the process and open the Knox Asset Intelligence agent. For more information, see the Knox Asset Intelligence documentation DualDAR compatibility check Starting with this release, the Knox Mobile Enrollment enrollment process will halt and show an error message if a profile with DualDAR is assigned to an unsupported device.

REST API enhancement to retrieve specific device information Previously, the Get Devices operation in the REST API returned all the information logged for a specific device. With the 22.11 release, the Get Devices operation includes an optional new parameter that allows you to retrieve device information logged between a specific point in time through to the present. You can pass this parameter as either a number of hours, minutes, or even as a starting date. New Unassign Profile operation in the REST API Previously, the Unassign Profile operation in the REST API blocked all valid devices (valid device IDs like IMEI or serial number) that were submitted if even one invalid device ID was in the batch. Starting with 22.11, the Unassign Profile operation unassigns all valid device IDs you submit, regardless of any invalid device IDs in the batch. The response now contains separate lists of the valid devices, the devices that don't exist, and all the invalid devices. The endpoint is also changed to `/kcs/v2/kme/devices/unassignProfile`.

Update to supported Android versions In accordance with our updated Android support plan, the minimum supported version for Android devices registered in Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Configure, and Knox Deployment app have each rolled forward. To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Simplified registration for and access to Knox cloud services The registration and access flows for Knox cloud services are streamlined. The My Knox dashboard is retired, and you can now sign in to the Knox Admin Portal directly and manage your Knox services, including Knox Mobile Enrollment. After you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you can operate Knox Mobile Enrollment right away. If you'd like to display or register for additional Knox services, click your account icon > Settings > Show/hide services. Advanced profiles for active Knox Suite license holders With the 23.03 release, Knox Mobile Enrollment introduces advance profiles, a new type of profile that complements regular profiles and lets you: Automatically lock a device if it isn't enrolled by an EMM within a window of time. You can set the window to be 1-30 days after a profile is pushed to a device. The enrollment status is checked once per day. Remotely lock or unlock one or more devices - to prevent data leaks - in the event of device theft or loss. Immediately lock a device if it's rooted or running unofficial firmware. For more information, see Knox Mobile Enrollment advanced profiles. Advanced profile features require an active Knox Suite license. If your tenant doesn't have one available when you enroll a device with an EMM, the device will enroll, but the advanced features won't be available for it. Back to release notes",

Resolution To enroll devices from another region, you must create a second KME/KC admin account at SamsungKnox.com and select the corresponding country.

Customers using these devices in conjunction with Knox Mobile Enrollment have reported experiencing an issue where the enrollment data isn't passed to their chosen EMM after the restart. Due to this behavior, the device user must manually intervene. What is True Single SKU? When you purchase a new Galaxy device, it will come pre-loaded with network-specific features and services, depending on where the device has been purchased from. This is because most devices have a specific service provider or SKU that indicates which network they are connected to. With True Single SKU, new devices have a common service provider. This means that when the device is set up, it will determine what service provider is being used and apply the specific service provider SKU. True Single SKU devices will connect to a server during the initial setup to get information about the service provider. After setup has finished, the device will restart to apply the network specific features and services. Cause During SKU setup, the device restarts, which can interrupt the Knox Mobile Enrollment flow, which in turn prevents vital enrollment data from passing to your EMM. Resolution The device setup process has been updated to complete the service provider update after the TSS setup. The following is the setup process order: 1. Begin enrolling the device through Knox Mobile Enrollment. 2. After the device is connected to a Wi-Fi APN, the True Single SKU setup begins. 3. When prompted, restart the device. 4. Complete device enrollment with Knox Mobile Enrollment. If the service provider update is interrupted during the True Single SKU setup, the wizard notifies you. One possible error message is: > There was a problem connecting. Service provider features will be set up later when your phone is able to connect. After an interruption, if you proceed through the on-screen instructions, you're presented with the option on the home screen to postpone the setup by tapping Remind in 30 minutes.

EMMs have provided management features for these apps based on this. However, some customers are reporting that their devices stopped preloading these two apps. This caused an issue where certain APIs such as BrowserPolicy and EmailPolicy are returning errors when those apps don't exist in the device. To manage this, KME clients are installing the apps during the out-of-box KME enrollment process if they are not preloaded in the device. What has changed? Many EMMs and customers have been installing and managing these apps via Managed Google Play instead of integrating Knox APIs and using them for app management. Since there are fewer and fewer customers who benefit from this feature, KME will be deprecating it on devices with Android 11 or higher via the September 1st, 2021 release. This will remove the auto-install of the apps and reduce KME enrollment time. After the update, if you want to manage Samsung Internet or Samsung Email apps, you can install and manage them via Managed Google Play.

When you purchase a new Galaxy device, it comes pre-loaded with network-specific features and services depending on where the device was purchased from. The features and services are determined by the specific service provider or SKU indicating which network they are connected to. With True Single SKU, new devices have a common service provider. When the device is set up, its service provider is automatically determined and the specific service provider SKU is applied. True Single SKU devices connect to a server during the initial setup to get information about the service provider. After setup has finished, the device will restart to apply the network-specific features and services. Some Galaxy devices require public internet connection during the initial device setup wizard. The following URL and port number should be whitelisted as a trusted site for enterprises attempting to reach destination Knox servers.

When a device user in China enrolls a device in an EMM using a QR code from Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, they might encounter an error after scanning the code where the EMM agent fails to download and install. The following error then displays on the device: > Error > > Couldn't enroll your phone because there are missing files necessary for enrollment. Contact Support if the problem continues. Cause The hosting servers that EMMs use to provide app downloads aren't always available or accessible in China. When the device user scans the QR code to download the EMM agent, the link in the QR code might not be reachable. For example, if the QR code consists of the following URI: https://discovery.awmdm.com/mobileenrollment/airwatchagent.apk The final URI will be https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/getwsone/download.html, and the automatic installation fails. Resolution You must generate the QR code based on the URI that's actually accessible from the China region. Device users can use this QR code to successfully enroll their device. There are several methods to find the correct URI: Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct has preset URIs for some EMMs. When editing the EMM agent URI field, URI suggestions will autocomplete based on your input. These URIs will work with your network. You can also test the URI in your local environment. You can store the EMM agent package on your own server and provide your own URI for EMM deployment.

Ensure that the below resolution is performed by a Super Admin or a secondary admin with the appropriate permissions.

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it. Purchase Knox commercial licenses from your local reseller. Server-based licenses Server-based licenses include both cloud and on-premises services.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "title": "Universal Credential Management (UCM)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

            "content": "Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "title": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps. Disable USB-connected updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from booting into Download Mode and installing a manual software update. This restriction includes updates through the Odin, Kies, and Smart Switch update tools.",

            "content": "Firewall Management. Most mobile device platforms use built-in firewalls, but don't provide granular control over firewall settings and activity. With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain. Per-app and device-wide modes - Give specific apps - for example, ones that handle confidential data - stronger firewalls, and all other apps on a device a more lenient firewall configuration. Log unsafe URL access The Knox Platform provides visibility into denied attempts to access blocked domains. The improved visibility helps you to remain aware of potential security breaches or insecure browsing practices within your organization. The Knox Platform logs reports with the following information: App name - The package name of the app attempting to access a blocked domain. Blocked domain URL - The URL of the domain name blocked by your firewall. Timestamp - The time the incident occurred, to assist with troubleshooting incidents.",

            "content": "Granular Device Management. The Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated, from partner feedback and industry data, to solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider. The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

These server resources can include the following Knox services: _Samsung license Servers_ - When you activate Knox services, devices need to verify their license keys. Devices periodically check their licenses a few times a week. _Samsung SDS IAM & EMM_ - If you're using an EMM, devices will need to access web-based EMM consoles and storage sites. _Samsung ActiveSync Server_ - If you're using Exchange ActiveSync, you'll need an ActiveSync Server connection so the email client can successfully reach the ActiveSync Server. If your organization doesn't permit connections with external servers, you can request an on-premises Knox Server to handle license verification within your firewall. Samsung charges an extra fee for this service. For more information, contact your Samsung representative or reseller. Ports 443 and 80 must be open within your local network domain to reach Knox server resources. Knox Cloud Services can utilize both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Firebase. Both services may also warrant adding to the allowlist within your organization's firewall policy. For information on the AWS that may require allowlist inclusion, see https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json. For information on the Google Firebase services that may require allowlist inclusion, see https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#ports_and_your_firewall.

After you successfully verify your Samsung account with the PIN sent to your email, you're redirected back to the Samsung Knox portal to complete your registration. Check that the details shown are correct, then click NEXT. 6. Fill in your company information, then click NEXT. 7. Review the Samsung Knox agreements, select the applicable boxes, then click SUBMIT. Your application is then submitted to the Samsung Knox team for approval, which may take a few days. You'll receive an email once you're approved. When you sign in after approval, you're then automatically taken to the Knox Admin Portal. Select your Knox services When you first sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you're greeted with a welcome screen that guides you through the steps to set up the portal. Then, you're prompted to select the Knox services you want to use. The services you select define which consoles you see in the portal. Some services are already selected based on the services you were approved for, but you can always show or hide services later. Depending on the additional services you select, you might need to acknowledge some terms and conditions or privacy policies to continue. Once you confirm your selection, the Knox Admin Portal shows the services you chose in the navigation pane. You can now seamlessly access Knox service features. You'll only receive system emails for the services you selected. Navigate the dashboard By default, you'll see a dashboard upon sign-in to the Knox Admin Portal.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to. Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account. Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service. Once you're finished editing, click SAVE to record your changes. Alternatively, you can choose to delete the role. Click DELETE at the bottom of the page to remove the role from the list and remove the associated permissions for all admins who are assigned to the role. Note that this action can't be undone.",

If your organization has devices enrolled in multiple Knox cloud services, the Knox Admin Portal offers a single, consolidated view that displays a device's details across all the services it's enrolled in. If you're a managed service provider admin, device and service info is limited to the customer you're currently managing. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, enter a device IMEI or serial number to view Knox service info for that device, shown as a centralized device info page. If the device you're searching for has two SIMs, you can enter either the primary or secondary IMEI to view its info. You can also navigate to this device view from the Device page in each individual service console by clicking View all device information. The centralized device info page displays the following: SERVICE - If the device is registered in a Knox cloud service and its user is invited to the service, the service name is shown. Click a service name to open the device's details on that service console and make updates to its info as required. Clicking a Knox Manage (KM) link opens that page on the KM console in a new browser tab. DEVICE STATUS - The last known enrollment status of the device, as reported by the service.

For example, if the service is KM, the device's associated user ID, organization, and/or group are shown. SERVICE END DATE - The date when the service or license expires.

            "content": "Knox Admin Portal 21.09 release notes. Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

Support for Samsung account login using Google SSO In this release, IT admins accessing the Knox Admin Portal through the direct console link can now sign in to their Samsung account using Google SSO. On the Samsung Account sign-in page, a Continue with Google button is available at the bottom of the screen. An IT admin can click this button to log in with their Google credentials and access the Knox Admin Portal. Okta SSO integration With 21.11, IT admins can set up Okta SSO to log in to SamsungKnox.com and the Knox Admin Portal. The three available SSO options are as follows: 1. Okta 2. Microsoft Azure AD 3. Ping Identity Please note that once Okta SSO is set up for a Knox cloud services tenant, its users can no longer log in to Knox services with their Samsung account credentials. See Configure Okta SSO settings for integration steps. Refreshed navigation sidebar The Knox Admin Portal navigation sidebar was refreshed for Knox cloud service 21.11.

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

            "content": "About Secured by Knox, Android - Others and Android Go devices. Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

Using KDA, some administrators have reported that they are not able to enroll devices in more than one KCS. When adding a device in a second service (e.g. enrolling in Knox Mobile Enrollment after enrolling in Knox Configure), the following error message is shown: > The device is already enrolled. Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process.

To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted. You may continue to use Knox products on such devices, but the Samsung teams won't provide support for issues on those devices. For security and performance, we recommend upgrading your Android devices to meet the minimum supported version requirements.
