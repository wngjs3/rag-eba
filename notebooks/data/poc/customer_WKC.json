            "content": "Knox Configure for Wearables. Knox Configure for wearables (WKC) is a cloud-based service that empowers enterprises to customize and automate the enrollment of Samsung wearable devices purchased from authorized Samsung resellers. Knox Configure for wearable devices simplifies the out-of-box experience and enables a large range of configuration options. #Audience This document is intended for: IT Admins - Admins create profiles with the device settings, restrictions, apps, and other content to deploy to groups of devices. After devices have been successfully enrolled in the enterprise, they receive the KC device profile via a Wi-Fi or mobile data connection. Resellers - Resellers bulk upload devices on behalf of requesting customers. Try the solution Use WKC to configure and customize wearable devices. Unlike phones and tablets, wearable devices utilize unique Tizen based applications and animation specific to the wearable device platform. START TUTORIAL About Knox Configure for wearables Knox Configure is available in separate Setup and Dynamic editions for wearable devices. The Setup edition allows you to deploy settings and profiles a single time with no additional incremental updates available. This profile is designed for customers who want to re-brand devices for their own consumers out-of-the-box. The Setup edition includes a select subset of the policies and settings available in the Dynamic edition's normal mode such as: Pull the latest watch profile, Customize the appearance of the default watch face, Customize the appearance of the booting and shutdown animation, Hide setting and menu elements, Turn USB debugging mode on/off, Remap hardware keys, Disallows software updates, Define custom connectivity settings including , Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , GPS , Airplane mode , NFC , Disable a limited amount of apps To change a wearable device configuration after initial policies are set, the wearable device must be factory reset and the new policies must be re-applied. The Dynamic edition allows you to deploy and update enrolled wearable device policies as many times as needed without a factory reset. Designed for IT admins to configure and customize devices for their employees both dynamically over-the-air and out-of-the-box. The Dynamic edition includes all the policies and settings available in the Setup edition, plus many more. For example: Ability to dynamically push updates to settings, content and applications, ProKiosk mode for purpose-built device setup and management, App restriction (allowlist/blocklist). App disable capabilities. Disabling Capabilities for power saving, lock screen enabling and USB debugging. Restrictions for power-off, factory resets, screen captures and software updates. A lock menu is now available for just devices configured with a dynamic edition Knox Configure profile, and is no longer available for setup edition profiles. If some of the selected target devices are currently assigned a Setup edition profile, the lock menu is disabled until just Dynamic edition devices are selected for update. Learn more about Knox Configure's features by going to the Knox Configure landing page. Knox wearable devices doesn't support Enterprise edition profiles. Prerequisites To begin using Knox Configure for wearable devices: 1. Purchase supported wearable devices from a participating reseller. 2. Sign up for a Samsung Knox portal account. 3. Request access to Knox Configure. 4. Set the correct firewall exceptions to connect to the protected network domain and securely connect to the Knox Configure server. 5. Use a supported browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome). Note that Internet Explorer isn't recommended if using an on-premise MDM. Common Criteria can't be enabled for wearable devices enrolled in Knox Configure. If Common Criteria is enabled, Knox Configure profiles cannot be effectively implemented for wearable devices. #Device User Prerequisites Note that for a wearable device to receive push updates, it needs a network connection through the following options: 1. Without phone connection (WPC) mode , Connect the wearable device to a network by Wi-Fi and receive push updates set by the IT admin through an access point (AP). Or connect the wearable device to a mobile network. 2. Bluetooth companion mode , Connect the wearable device to a network through a mobile device when using companion mode. The deployment process Using the Samsung Knox Configure web console, IT admins and System integrators can create profiles with device settings, restrictions, apps and other custom content to deploy to groups of devices. After devices have been successfully enrolled in the enterprise, they will receive device profiles via Wi-Fi or mobile data. Using a web-based console, IT Admins create profiles with wearable device settings, restrictions, apps, and other content to deploy to groups of wearable devices. After wearable devices have been successfully enrolled in the enterprise, they receive their configuration profiles via Wi-Fi or mobile data. The Knox Configure portal doesn't support these special characters: # / $ \\* % ^ & \\\\ ( ) + ? [ ]. Ensure they are not utilized when inputting characters within the portal. The image below outlines the steps required in the Knox Configure deployment process. A profile push can be completed by the device user by pressing FINISH on their wearable device, or after a 5 second auto-timer expires. The watch's FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a 5 second timer underneath them to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input after the 5 second timer countdown, the device screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. This reduces the labor required with large deployments, where the FINISH or RESTART button must be pressed to deploy each wearable device.",

The last selected setting is retained if an admin signs out of KC then back in again. 3. Refer to the Date column to assess when each listed activity occurred. Optionally toggle the events to display the most recent activities first or last in the column. 4. Use the Name column to select and filter activities by selected admins and system integrators. This is a good option to drill down to activities and events by specific individuals and exclude unwanted activities. An icon appears on the right-hand side of the column when activity display filters have been applied to the name. 5. Refer to the Category column to filter listed activities by selected category. An icon appears on the right-hand side of the column when category display filters have been applied. Available category filter options include Accounts, Admins, Applications, Device Users, Devices, Licenses, MDM Profiles and Resellers. Select Clear filter to refresh the display back each available category option 6. Refer to the Event column to filter listed activities by selected event type. An icon appears on the right-hand side of the column when event display filters have been applied. Available event filter options include Added, Approved, Configured, Deleted, Downloaded, Invited, Joined, Modified, Registered, Removed, and Uploaded. These events provide a means to filter activities strategically as devices complete various milestones of the Knox Configure configuration and approval process prior to deployment. Select Clear filter to automatically refresh the display back all available activity log events. 7. Refer to the Description column to assess who initiated an activity resulting in the log update. Descriptions cannot be filtered like categories and events, but the description is an important resource describing who created or modified a configuration profile that resulted in an activity log update. 8. The Detail column displays a View link that can be optionally selected to the profile configuration dashboard to assess which portions of the profile configuration have been updated from their default settings. 9. If needed, select the Export to CSV option to save the entire log as a CSV file that can be used with 3rd party tools (like Google Sheets). Up to 10,000 activity log entries can be contained within a single CSV file.",

            "content": "Manage admins and roles. This topic describes how to invite and manage admins, as well as assign the required roles and permissions needed to complete an admin invitation. Knox Configure now supports a new _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to the KC service specifically, the Super Admin role cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. Create a role To create a role: 1. Select Administrators and Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the ROLES tab. 3. From the ACTIONS drop-down menu, select Create role. 4. Provide the following role details: Role name - Enter unique name for the role to help you identify the newly created role during assignment. Description - Enter a description for the role. Max 200 characters permissible. Allow access to the Knox Configure portal - Admins with this role will be granted basic permissions. Note that additional permissions will need to be specified as needed. Profiles - Add View only or Manage profile permissions. Add the ability to Create and edit and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Devices and Uploads - Add View only or Manage devices permissions. Add the ability to Assign and push update, Unassign, Reboot/Factory reset, Manage tags and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Licenses - Add View only or Manage licenses permissions. Add the ability to Add and edit, and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Library - Add View only or Manage library permissions. Add the ability to Add,edit and download, and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Resellers - Add View only or Manage reseller permissions. Add the ability to Register and edit reseller, and approve uploads, and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Activity log - Add the permission to View activity log to the role. Administrative privileges - Specify the following role privileges: Invite and Manage administrators, and Manage roles. The ability to Create and manage roles is a highly critical permission. Admins with this permission can also add and edit roles to include any permissions in the list. Allow access to Knox Deployment Application - Admins with this permission can enroll devices in Knox Configure using the Knox Deployment Application. 5. Click Save. Edit or delete a role Existing roles can be modified or deleted as their configurations warrant update or deletion from administrator assignment. To edit or delete an existing role: 1. Select Administrators & Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Ensure the ROLES tab is displayed. 3. Select a role whose configuration requires deletion and removal from Knox Configure. 4. Either edit the configuration of the existing role and select SAVE, or select the DELETE button at the bottom of the screen to permanently remove the role. Optionally revise the existing Role name and Description. When permissions require restriction to view only access for certain permission areas, consider selecting the View only option. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. If there are administrators currently using this role and screen displays stating the administrators assigned this role will receive updated permissions based on your role revisions. Select CONFIRM to proceed. When deleting a role with administrators already assigned, existing administrators assigned to a role intended for deletion must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. Any pending, revoked, or blocked admins assigned the deleted role are assigned a role of NoRole. Select the DELETE button to proceed with the role deletion. Invite an admin If you haven't yet, ensure that you create a role prior to inviting an admin. Once you've created admin roles,\"IT admins can be invited from within the Knox Configure portal as needed and assigned roles with unique permissions. Note that there's a limitation to administrative roles and permissions: Only selected IT admins are approved to enroll and manage devices on behalf of customers. When inviting admins, a Managed role permission is required. Existing admins without a Managed role permission are limited to inviting admins to a role that matches their own set of role permissions. In the Invite administrator screen, the Role drop-down menu has been customized to correspond to the particular admin's role when creating the invitation. Knox Configure administrators can either be invited individually or in bulk: #Invite an admin 1. Select Administrators and Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the ADMINISTRATORS tab. 3. From the ACTIONS drop-down menu, select Invite administrator. 4. Provide the following to complete an administrator invitation: First Name - Provide the first name of the administrator resource for this invitation. Last Name - Provide the last name of the administrator resource for this invitation. Email - If this email is not already associated with a Samsung Account, the user will have to create a Samsung Account before logging in to Knox Configure. The creation of a Samsung account is required before an administrative account can be created. Role - Use the drop-down menu to assign this new administrator a role that is appropriate to their intended administrative function. If unsure about the exact permissions of an available role, select View Role Details to review the scope of its available permissions. Samsung Knox doesn't support personal email addresses for new Knox account requests that have not been registered as a Samsung account. However, they can be invited as additional admins. 5. Select INVITE when completed. The newly added, but pending, administrator displays by name, with their name displaying as a link that can be selected to update the administrator name and company management designation. If editing the administrator's profile, select Save. #Bulk invite administrators If necessary, administrators can be invited in bulk with just a single CSV file bulk upload operation. To bulk invite administrators: 1. Select Administrators and roles from the left-hand navigation menu. Ensure the ADMINISTRATORS tab is selected. 2. Select Bulk invite administrators from the ACTIONS drop-down menu. 3. Within the UPLOAD\"administrators list field, browse for a properly formatted CSV file containing the names of the admins you intend to invite. Optionally, Download CSV file template to utilize an existing Knox Configure template for easier creation and submission of the bulk administrator invitation. 4. Use the Select role drop-down menu to select a role that will be applied to all the administrators included within the CSV file. 5. Once the CSV file and role are defined, select the INVITE button to proceed with the bulk administrator invitation. The administrators within the CSV file are added to the ADMINISTRATORS tab with a pending status before they are promoted to an Active status or are Revoked or Blocked.",

            "content": "Assign a profile to a device. Once a profile is configured, you're ready to assign and deploy the profile to a device. The process begins with adding a wearable device to Knox Configure, then assigning and deploying a profile to the wearable device. Note that wearable devices can be locked by carriers and resellers post deployment. Prerequisites For a wearable device to receive push updates,\"it must first be connected to a network. Ensure that the user is connected through the following options: 1. Without phone connection (WPC) mode , Connect the wearable device to a network by Wi-Fi and receive push updates set by the IT admin through an access point (AP). Or connect the wearable device to a mobile network. 2. Bluetooth companion mode , Connect the wearable device to a network through a mobile device when using companion mode. Companion mode overrides the watch's Wi-Fi configurations and always on/off policies set by the IT admin since it automatically follows the mobile device's network connections. To prevent configuration override, you can disable Bluetooth to prevent the user from switching from WPC to companion mode. Use the Knox Deployment app to add a wearable device You can use the Knox Deployment app to add a wearable device to Knox Configure. Before beginning, ensure that your wearable device is paired with a phone. Once wearable device is paired with a phone and connectivity is established, use the KDA app to deploy the Knox Configure profile and follow the prompts on your wearable device to enroll to Knox Configure: #Knox Deployment App\"(KDA) To read about Knox Deployment App (KDA) and Two Factor Authentication (2FA) in detail, see Knox Configure > Features > Knox Deployment App. Using your phone, follow the steps to use the KDA: 1. Download the Knox Deployment App from the Google Play Store. 2. Tap on the KDA app icon to open the app. 3. Enter the following information from your Samsung Account: Email address , Password 4. Tap Sign in. 5. Tap Profile, then select the target configured wearable profile. 6. Tap Deployment mode > Bluetooth, then select the duration. Tap OK when done. Optionally set the phone to automatically accept pairing request from enrolling devices. You can enroll wearable devices using Knox Configure: Knox Configure for wearables support Knox Deployment apps on devices with Tizen 4.0 and above. #Enroll your wearable device On your wearable device: 1. Turn on the wearable device and go through the device setup procedures. If the wearable device has already been in use, you may first have to initiate a Factory reset. If you have not done so already, ensure that the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network. 2. Once turned on, Knox Configure prompts you to begin the enrollment process for the wearable device. 3. Tap Continue. 4. Read the EULA and tap Agree to enroll the device. The following processes occur: The wearable device downloads its target profile , If their are Tizen-based wearable apps are in the profile, the device downloads and installs those apps , Knox Configure activates a license , The wearable device downloads other required content 5. When the wearable device is successfully enrolled, a confirmation screen displays. If configured as a ProKiosk, a reboot is required. To reduce the labor required with large deployments, a wearable device profile push can be completed by the end user pressing FINISH on their device, or after a 5 second auto-timer expiration. The device FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a 5 second timer underneath them to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input after the 5 second timer countdown, the device screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. Automatically add a device through your reseller Resellers can add wearable devices to your Knox Configure account on your behalf. When a wearable device is purchased from a reseller, they can automatically upload it to your account. Once your reseller uploads a wearable device to your KC account, you will be notified by email that you have pending uploads to view and approve. After you approve your uploaded devices, you'll be able to assign a profile to customize the device. #Approve uploaded devices To approve devices uploaded by your reseller: 1. Launch the Knox Configure Portal though the Samsung Knox dashboard. 2. Select Devices from the left-hand navigation menu. 3. Select UPLOADS. 4. View the pending upload by clicking View. 5.

The device FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a 5 second timer underneath them to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input before the 5 second timer countdown is completed, the device screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. This reduces the labor required with large deployments, where the FINISH or RESTART button must be pressed to deploy each device. Select a license Select a license to use to assign a profile. If necessary, you may skip this step and create and save the profile without a license assignment. For Setup Edition, \"Per Device Staggered\" license enables efficient license utilization by ensuring a Setup Edition license is only activated once a device is activated. For Dynamic edition, \"Per Seat\" license enables IT admins to revoke a license on a device, for example a previous employee's device, and utilize the license on a different device using the same Dynamic edition profile. This increases the available license count and improves license provisioning with the Dynamic edition profile. Note that only active licences are compatible with this profile display. If you haven't yet, ensure you obtain a valid license for Knox Configure. To select a license: 1. Click the radio button under License name. 2. Press Next.

To change a device configuration after initial policies are set, devices must be factory reset and the new policies must be re-applied. The Setup edition includes a select subset of the policies and settings available in the Dynamic edition's normal mode. Introduction To date, if a device is configured and its assigned profile is changed, a profile push update is made regardless of the profile's edition (Setup or Dynamic). New rules are now in place to restrict Setup edition profiles from receiving a push update. A Dynamic profile can still push update another Dynamic edition profile, and a Setup edition profile can still push update a Dynamic edition profile. However, a Setup edition profile can no longer update another Setup edition profile, nor can a Dynamic edition profile push update a Setup edition profile. When an IT administrator pushes an updated configuration, each device utilizing the updated profile receive the configuration update, whether intended or not. With this enhancement, an IT admin can selected individual devices for push updates from the portal's PROFILES tab or at the time of profile modification. This helps administrators update just those specific devices intended to receive a specific update and exclude those devices that do not need to receive the updates. This section will guide you through the Configuration tab when creating a profile.

Background push updates now permitted This enhancement enables an IT admin or system integrator to push an updated profile or application to Samsung Gear wearable devices without any related UI displaying on the target device. This enables the wearable device user to continue to use their device without interruption, as profile or application updates occur in the background. Frictionless Customization Currently, when an error occurs during wearable device enrollment, the enrollment process stops, regardless of the error type, and a failure is reported to KC server. Additionally, the current messaging is inadequate to properly define the scope and severity of the problem that halted enrollment. Watch face alteration and deletion prevention This feature addresses requests by IT admins who need a dynamic profile restriction policy option that prevents wearable device users from changing their device's watch face, once it is configured and set on the device. Disallow application uninstall This feature enables an IT admin to configure a list of applications that cannot be uninstalled by the device user post enrollment and deployment. Removing an application from the disallow uninstall app list removes the uninstall restriction, and provides the device user the capability to remove the application from their device. If utilizing a setup edition profile, just a single application is permitted in the uninstall prevention list. Dynamic profile updates and management This enhancement enables an IT admin to assign a new profile to devices already having an assigned profile. If a device is configured with an old profile, a push notification for a profile update is delivered and the device can updated with a new profile. The device's status updates to \"Update pushed\" and then moves to \"Configured\" once the updated configuration is applied to the device. The transition from the old profile to the new profile is seamless. If the new profile has different profile information (company, email, and phone number etc.), it should be processed on the target device without disruption. Additionally, if the old profile is utilizing a ProKiosk mode setting, the device exits ProKiosk mode and is re-configured based on the settings of the new profile. Application deployment improvements To date, if an application does not support a Gear S3LTE (R765) model wearable device, the wearable Knox Configure back-end returns an invalid package error. To broaden the list of supported wearable devices the Gear S3 BT or Gear Sports are now also included, so an IT admin can add a wearable application for those devices as well. New profile push policies supported To date, if a wearable device's assigned profile is changed, a profile push update occurs regardless of the profile's edition. New rules are now in place to restrict setup edition profiles from receiving a push update. A dynamic profile can still push update another dynamic edition profile, and a setup edition profile can push update a dynamic edition profile. However, a setup edition profile can no longer update another setup edition profile, nor can a dynamic edition profile push update a setup edition profile. Back to release notes",

Simplified wearable app deployment process This feature enables IT admins to upload a wearable app directly into the WKC console. This enhancement simplifies the app deployment process for wearable devices, because IT admins will no longer need to register apps on the Galaxy Store. When an uploaded app is \"Ready to deploy\", the IT admin can add the app to a profile. After pushing the profile update, an email is sent to the user to provide notification that app signing has been a success. If app signing fails, the email notification enables IT admins to promptly respond to a failed signing event. Learn more about uploading a wearable application. Note that an error message will appear if an unsupported file format is uploaded, or if the file exceeds a specific size, an error message. The supported file format is .tpk. Option added to disable NFC This feature provides more control over device connectivity by enabling the IT admin to disable NFC from the Knox Configure Console. Included in this update is a tool tip that notifies the user that they'll be unable to change the NFC settings once disabled by the IT admin. Back to release notes",

Role-based access control improvements This release introduces a new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to the KC service specifically, the Super Admin role cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available. For more information on creating an administrator and assigning them roles and permissions, go to: Manage admins and roles. Back to release notes",

Once the feature is selected, admins can create a Setup edition profile and assign devices before activating a Setup edition license. Once each device is activated, each license expiration date will depend on the device's activation date. This feature addresses customer concerns to only activate a Setup edition license once each device is actually activated. This enables customers to utilize licenses more efficiently, since a customer may not initially use Knox Configure after it is purchased, or deploy devices at the same time. Note that feature availability will vary per country. Existing KC SKUs will be kept as is, and are not immediately impacted by this change. Official notice will be shared with KC console users via email and console notifications two weeks prior to this release. \"Per Seat\" license for Dynamic edition profiles New to Knox Configure is the ability to revoke a license on one device for reallocation to another device. This new feature improves license provisioning efficiency with the Dynamic edition profile by utilizing the revoked licenses to increase the available license count. Note that feature availability will vary per country. Existing KC SKUs will be kept as is, and are not immediately impacted by this change. Official notice will be shared with KC console users via email and console notifications two weeks prior to this release. Assign multiple licenses to a profile To date, creating a profile required an assigned license. With this release, profile creation and license assignment are no longer linked. Each device will now follow the behaviour of their individually assigned license type. This new feature allows legacy licenses and new licenses to be used concurrently in the same profile, or if necessary, a profile can be created and saved without assigning a license. Knox Deployment App (KDA) license enhancement With this release, admins who are using KDA to enroll devices now have the option of explicitly assigning a license for KDA at profile creation. Note that licenses previously utilized with legacy profiles created prior to this release will be automatically migrated to KDA licenses. Only one license can be assigned for KDA. If the license is consumed or expires, the license will need to be replaced. KDA only access permission This feature allows admins to specify the use of only KDA for Bluetooth enrolments, without accessing the Knox Configure console. To do this, admins are required to log into KDA to choose a Knox Configure Cloud service, select a profile, pair the admin device to the target device, and assign the profile to the target device. Additionally, admins can give permission to allow access to KDA to enroll into Knox Configure directly using KDA. Admins now capable of being invited to multiple services An enhancement to Knox Configure now includes the ability to specify Administrative privileges.To date, admins were unable to invite admins from a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or Admin with a Manage role privilege can now invite another admin from a different service to a role in their service. For example, an admin for KC can invite another admin from KME. Note that existing admins without a Manage role permission are restricted to only inviting admins with a matching set of their own role permission. For example, a non-super admin won't be able to invite a Super admin from another service if they don't currently have Super admin permissions. Back to release notes",

View only admin permission added This enhancement to role-based access includes the option to create roles with View only permissions for Profiles, Devices and Uploads, Licenses, Library, and Resellers. When selecting the View only radio button, note that options under the manage permissions radio button will be disabled. Alternatively, when applying manage permissions, at least one manage permission option must then be selected. Existing roles that inherit the new View only permission will have the option off by default to prevent conflict issues, while new roles will have the View only permission selected by default. Italian console translation available In response to Italian customer requests, customers and subsidiaries in that country have requested an update to the Italian text with their own regional translations. Impacted areas within the console include: Dashboard, Devices > Devices, Licenses, Licenses > Activated Seats description, Feedback & Support > Resources, Profiles > Create a profile > Select edition, Profile editing > Application and content, Profile editing > Sound & display, Library > media > Actions > Add media > Create animation Improvements to error messaging This release includes improvements to both the portal UI and corresponding error code definitions. Error messages have been updated to provide additional information specific to the event in order to assist admins in troubleshooting and in making informed decisions. Profile deletion improvements To date, when a profile is selected from within the console's Profiles tab, the Delete profiles option is disabled from the Actions drop-down menu, even though the profile isn't assigned to a device. The user, not knowing the reason this option is disabled, is understandably confused. To remedy this situation, the user must consent to the deletion within a pop-up message. However, if there any default profiles selected for deletion, a message displays stating they cannot be deleted since they have already been uploaded by the listed reseller. Profile licensing enhancements An enhancement to profile licensing has been included in this release to enable admins to enter license keys before assigning the license to a profile. This feature allows admins to enter a license key which will then be added to the license drop-down menu. For more information, go to License Management. Disable power saving mode for Kiosk mode With this release, IT admins now have the option of disabling Power Saving mode for Kiosk mode profiles. This new feature disables user access to Power Saving mode to enhance work flow productivity for devices with ProKiosk mode profiles.

App version display enhancements Included in this release are enhancements to the Application Details screen, which improves on how apps display their version information. Prior to this release, apps were displayed on the app list without their current version information, which can make it difficult to identify latest versions for potential device updates. For additional details, go to app management. With this enhancement, apps are now listed separately with the following details: Version - Displays version number of the app. Name - Displays the Application Name assigned when uploading the app to Knox Configure. Description - Displays the Description entered when uploading the app to Knox Configure. Used in profiles - Displays profiles the app is assigned to. Size - Displays the TPK or WGT file size for the wearable app. Modified - Displays the timestamp the app was last modified. Revoke WKC policies manually before a device is assigned a different profile When a WKC profile configuration changes from profile A to B, the profile revokes its previously defined policies from profile A, then applies its new policies from the profile B. For example, in Setup to Dynamic, Dynamic to Setup, Setup to Setup, and Dynamic to Dynamic profile changes. Note that if a Per Seat license is being used, a push command is sent out once the device is unassigned from its previous profile. Knox Custom policies now revoked once WKC is uninstalled This feature ensures Knox Custom policies are revoked once WKC is uninstalled by adding the Knox Custom policy revocation logic before `mdm_uninstall_application()` is called. Activity log updates for admin events With this release are enhancements to the Activity log to provide a broader range of admin event changes for easier debugging. These admin events include: Admin invitations, Admin modifications, Resent, reactivated or revoked invitations, Deactivated or reactivated accounts Activity log name clarification To date, when an event was administrated by a Samsung Admin, both the names: Samsung Administrator and Samsung Knox Team were displayed within the activity log. This inconsistency raised the question whether there are two different admin types. To improve consistency, all activity log events administrated by a Samsung admin will display the name Samsung Knox Team. Warning message improvements when for profile unassignment Starting this release, a warning message will appear to notify admins that unassigning a profile from a device would result in no longer being able to control the device or push a profile update. KC supported country added under SEWA subsidiary : Nigeria Nigeria has been added to the list of supported countries for KC. Nigeria will be listed under the West Africa (SEWA) subsidiary.

Booting animation enhancements Currently, when deselecting the Set a custom booting animation option on a profile, the existing booting animation and sound are not cleared as expected from the wearable device when an update is pushed to the device. The same expectation should occur when deselecting the Set a custom shutdown animation option on a profile: The shutdown animation and sound should be cleared when an update is pushed to the device. To date, WKC checks if an existing animation was set by a previous WKC profile, and will not remove the animation if it was set for a previous profile. To remedy this, users now have the ability to remove booting or shutdown animation separately when pushing an update. Enrollment improvements To date, when a profile is assigned and a wearable device has 15% power or less remaining, enrollment stops during the authentication stage after accepting the End User License Agreement (EULA). Once the wearable device is charged and rebooted, the device is expected to resume enrollment. However, enrollment doesn't resume if Power Saving mode is enabled, even if it was disabled just before license activation. To prevent enrollment disruptions, Power Saving mode is now automatically disabled at the start of enrollment and enabled again after license activation. Auto select newly uploaded apps To date, in order to deploy an app that's been recently uploaded into a profile, you would need to select the app manually from the app list after it's been uploaded. As part of this release, newly uploaded apps are now auto selected to enhance the app deployment work flow. Dashboard widget UI enhancements As part of a UI enhancement in this release, when an account has no profiles, the dashboard displays a Create profile button instead of the profile widgets. Selecting it starts the profile creation screen flow. If there are profiles in the account, a Select profile to pin here button is displayed. Selecting enables the user to pin profiles for quick access from the dashboard. Enhanced console string responses Included in this release are updates to the console response strings, which include error and success messages. Updated strings have been enhanced to include meaningful messages to assist with troubleshooting. For example, if an event has an error log entry associated with it, the log will include a link with additional information. Unable to select KDA licenses before activation date Currently, during profile creation, you won't be able to select the Knox Deployment App (KDA) license key is entered if the date of entry is before the set activation date. As part of an update in this release, the license drop-down menu will now include applicable licenses: Both active with remaining seats, as well as licenses that have yet to start.

EAP for wearable devices Prior to this release, customers were unable to deploy wearable devices in areas where enterprise Wi-Fi was required for internal communication. Customers have requested to connect to a staging profile, deploy a profile, exit Kiosk mode on the wearable, authenticate into an Enterprise Wi-Fi (EAP-PEAP), pull-down a certificate, then re-deploy a Kiosk supported profile. However, this is not practical for deployments supporting thousands of wearable devices. With this release, admins can now create a profile and set its Advanced Wi-Fi setting's security type to 802.1x EAP (using either PEAP or TTLs). Admins can assign this profile to target devices to configure the deployment area's access point (AP) resource with 802.1x EAP as a hidden state to enable Wi-Fi connectivity for configured devices. This feature provides the ability to simultaneously provision a large number of EAP Wi-Fi supported wearable devices in for time and cost savings. The following Advanced Wi-Fi setting security type is not yet supported in this release: TTLS + NONE, and TTLS + GTC Download profile summary as a PDF With this release, an authenticated user can now download profile summary settings as a PDF to easily review settings and to conveniently use the output to create profiles in other accounts. The PDF output closely resembles the KC profile summary page that displays once a profile is configured and saved. To generate a PDF output of the profile summary: 1. Click Profiles from the left-hand navigation. 2. Click the profile link of the target device. 3. Once in the Profile configuration dashboard, click DOWNLOAD PROFILE SUMMARY AS A PDF. Note that the PDF won't exceed 5 MB and will have a UTC timestamp included once it's downloaded. Reassign devices to current license after renewal To date, when a Knox Configure license expires, a profile is unassigned from its assigned device. However, customers often want to renew their existing license used by deployed devices, but when the license is renewed, customers are unable to re-assign their devices. Additionally, when an unassigned device is assigned a profile using a renewed license, the devices are consuming new seats even though they have activated the license before. As part of this release, devices will no longer consume new license seats when re-assigned to profiles under the same license. However, devices will need to be manually re-assigned the license within the KC console. This feature enables customers to re-assign their unassigned devices to a provile and reuse the renewed license without consuming additional license seats for cost savings and efficiency.

Support Additional Hidden Network and Internet Proxy DNS Addresses Wi-Fi Options A hidden network doesn't display on the device Wi-Fi manager, and a manual connection isn't possible. It's often easier to provision the devices with KC instead of sharing the SSID/PSWD with each employee using a wearable. While Knox Configure can push Wi-Fi profiles, there is no hidden profile option or proxy address input unless it is an IP Address. With this release, support has been added within the Device connectivity screen for additional Wi-Fi options, including hidden network SSID and Internet proxy DNS addresses. For more information on configuring wearable Knox Configure profiles, go to: Setup edition or Dynamic edition. Support Additional Wi-Fi Options (Wi-Fi Always ON) This feature enables Knox Configure supported wearables deployed in factories, and other large areas, to remain connected to their preferred corporate Wi-Fi network so urgent updates pushed by IT are received on time. With this release, an option has been added within the Device connectivity screen to Keep WiFi always on. When selected Wi-Fi remains continuously on, even when the battery is low. Keep in mind, enabling this setting prevents Wi-Fi from being turned off under any circumstances.

This option is available to both Setup and Dynamic edition wearable profiles. For more information on configuring wearable Knox Configure profiles, go to: Setup edition or Dynamic edition. Offline deactivation This feature addresses KC wearable admin requests to factory reset a wearable device after temporary usage or when no longer needed. This request becomes problematic when the Bluetooth connection between the paired phone and the wearable is broken, and there is no way for WKC to send a wipe and reset command and factory reset the wearable via the recovery mode.

Cause The default maximum profile size in Knox Configure is 300 MB. Profiles exceeding this limit may contain large images, sound files, document files, or uploaded applications. Resolution You can reduce the size of the public or internal applications in your profile to ensure your profile size is under the 300 MB limit: #For public applications: On the Add Applications and Widgets screen, instead of directly uploading the APK file to the KC profile with Upload Application, add the application using the Add from Google Play option. The Google Play store will need to be enabled for the applications to be able to be installed using this option. However, if you want to prevent end users from installing all other applications, you can whitelist specific applications to have the permission to be installed using the Installation allowlist feature under the Applications & Content page of your KC profile. Only the applications specified in this allowlist will be able to be installed on the device. Other applications will not be able to be installed even though Google Play is accessible. #For internal applications: If you want to install apps on your device from other trusted sources (i.e. FTP servers, company email), you can add bookmarks that link to these internal sources. Include these applications in the allowlist to ensure only trusted applications can be installed.

This method is especially useful for devices running an Android OS version below 9, as there is no way to verify the application's running state in Settings. Prerequisites This guide assumes you are using a Windows computer with the following installed: 1. ADB Toolkit 2. Google Android USB driver How do I verify if an app is running on my device? To check the running state of an app on your device: 1. Navigate to Settings and enable Max power saving mode. The message \"Security policy restricts you from stopping this application\" appears. 2. Tap the Recent applications view. If an app appears in the list, the Prevent applications from being stopped policy is applied to it. How do I verify if an app is in sleep/Doze mode with ADB? #On your device: 1. Navigate to Settings > About phone > Software information. 2. Tap Build Number 7 times to enable Developer options. 3. Navigate to the Settings menu again. Under Developer options, enable USB Debugging. #On your computer: 1. Connect the device to your computer via USB. When a prompt appears on the computer asking if you want to allow access to the device's data, click Allow. If this is the first time the device is connected, an additional prompt with the computer's RSA key fingerprint appears. Click OK. 2. On the device, run the application you want to test on the phone. In this example, we are using the Google Chrome app (com.android.chrome). 3. In the Windows Start Menu search bar, type `cmd` and select Windows Command Prompt. #In the command prompt: Change your current directory to where you extracted your ADB files. To do so, paste in the line below and replace the file path: `cd ` Then, run the following ADB command to initiate the ADB connection between device and computer, and simulate the device being unplugged from USB: `adb shell dumpsys battery unplug` Ensure that the app you are testing is running in the background. To get the app's activity status, enter the following ADB command: `adb shell am get-inactive com.android.chrome` `Idle=false` is printed on a new line, indicating that the application is actively running and not in sleep/Doze mode. Run the following ADB command to set the application to sleep or Doze mode: `adb shell am set-inactive com.android.chrome true` Then, run the earlier command to get the status of the app again: `adb shell am get-inactive com.android.chrome` If the result is `Idle=true`, the app was successfully put to sleep. If the result is `Idle=false`, there is a device policy preventing the app from entering sleep/Doze mode. For example, this command prompt window demonstrates what you see if this policy is not enforced on the device: After testing is complete, run the following command to establish the USB connection again: `adb shell dumpsys battery reset`",

            "content": "How to change configured devices to a different license key in Knox Configure. Overview This article guides you through the steps on how to switch a KC-configured device to a different license (e.g. a trial license) without unassigning the device. If the old license is about to expire, these steps must be performed before the license expiry date. When a KC\"license (trial or commercial) expires, there is a 30 day grace period to accommodate license renewal delays, after which any devices associated with the license are automatically unassigned from the profile\"they were configured to. If the same license key is renewed, there is no action required and you can continue to use the key as normal. You may also replace it with a new key within 30 days to avoid KC unassigning your devices. If a device is no longer in the \"configured\" state, KC cannot push profile updates or any other changes to the device. The device must manually trigger KC for any profile changes to be applied. There are three ways to do this: 1. From a browser on the device, navigate to configure.samsungknox.com, then select Re-enroll. 2. Navigate to the device settings > About Device > Software Info > Knox Configure > Apply latest profile. 3. Factory reset the device. If a device is automatically unassigned from KC, it remains configured to the profile unless the device user performs any of the 3 actions above. If the device is in the \"Unassigned\" state when the device user performs one of the 3 actions, then the device will be unconfigured. How do I change all my configured devices to a different license? Follow the steps below if you are: Switching all devices from a trial license to a commercial license, Switching all devices from a commercial license to a different commercial license 1. \u200bIn the KC console, under Licenses, select the old license you wish to replace. 2. Select the Actions dropdown and select Replace License. 3. Select the new license as instructed on the following page, then\"click Done. All devices previously assigned to the old license are now assigned to the new license key. How do I change only a select few devices to a different license? Follow the steps below if you are switching one device to a different license key: 1. In the KC console, under Licenses > Enter license key, add the new license key to the license tab. 2. Select the profile name you would like the devices to be configured to. If you are configuring the device to the same profile it is already configured to, you will need to clone the profile. Currently, it is not possible to change licenses within the same profile. To clone a profile, navigate to Profiles > Select the checkbox beside the profile name you would like to clone > Actions > Clone to edit. 3. Under Devices > select the Device ID of the device you wish to edit. 4. In the device details panel, select Edit. 5. In the Profile dropdown, either select the cloned profile created in Step 2 or a new profile you wish to apply to the device. 6. In the License dropdown, select the new license you wish to switch to. 7. Click Save. If you use this method, the device user is required to accept and apply the latest profile once the changes have been saved. They may also choose to postpone the update. If you want to push the update without user consent, please see the steps below. Follow the steps below if you are switching one or multiple devices to a different license key: 1. In the KC console, under Licenses > Enter license key, add the new license key to the license tab. 2. Select the profile name you would like the devices to be configured to. If you are configuring the device to the same profile it is already configured to, you will need to clone the profile. Currently, it is not possible to change licenses within the same profile. To clone a profile, navigate to Profiles > Select the checkbox beside the profile name you would like to clone > Actions > Clone to edit. 3. Select the devices tile > Actions > Assign devices. 4. Select the devices you want to assign. If you cannot find the device, ensure you are not filtering the devices by status. To clear the filter, select Status > Clear status. 5. Select Assign once all the devices you want to assign are selected. 6. Select No when a pop-up appears asking if you want to continue using the existing license. If you would like the devices to automatically receive the changes you are making, select Push update without requesting end-user consent. 7. Select the new license that you would like the devices to use, then click Submit. How do I renew my Knox Configure commercial license? To renew your KC commercial license, contact your KC license reseller. As a best practice, we recommend that you renew your commercial license instead of requesting a new one. If you renew your license, you can continue to use the same one, avoiding the steps associated with switching to a new license.",

Starting August 1st, 2021, EE Licenses will no longer be able to be generated in samsungknox.com EE devices no longer require a Knox Configure EE license key.

If you still have a Knox Configure EE legacy license key, EE devices released before August 1st, 2021 can still be assigned the EE legacy license key. EE devices released after August 1st, 2021 cannot be assigned an EE legacy license key. See more information about license key management in Knox Configure here.

            "content": "Renew and change Knox Configure licenses. When a trial or commercial Knox Configure license expires, there is a 30-day grace period to accommodate license renewal delays. After this period, any devices associated with the license are automatically unassigned from the profile they were configured to, and you won't be able to push profile updates, send lock and unlock commands, reboot, or factory reset your devices. Any previously scheduled pushes will also fail. If the same license is renewed, you don't need to take further action. You can also choose to replace your current license with a new one, but be sure to do so within 30 days to avoid your devices being unassigned. For more details about replacing an existing license, see License management in the Knox Configure admin guide. Who to contact to renew licenses To renew your commercial license, contact your Knox Configure license reseller. As a best practice, we recommend you renew your commercial license instead of requesting a new one. If you renew your license, you can avoid potential workflow disruptions caused by switching to a new license. What if I want to change the number of license assignments? If you want to increase the number of assignments on your existing license, you can contact your reseller to renew the license with additional assignments. If you want to decrease the number of assignments on the license, you'll need to request a new license instead. If the number of licenses assigned is higher than the number of assignments available on the renewed license, you won't be able to choose which devices are activated with the renewal. For example, say you had a license that had 20 assignments, and you assigned it to 20 devices. When it expired, you only renewed 15 assignments for the license. Knox Configure automatically selects 15 of the 20 devices previously activated on the license to activate on the new license. The other devices are then considered expired. If the expired devices aren't moved to a new license, they're unassigned after the 30-day grace period. The license details also show that the total number of assignments purchased is less than the number of activations. To prevent Knox Configure from automatically selecting devices for renewal, request a new license with the number of assignments you want, then switch the desired devices to it.

            "content": "Knox licenses. Samsung offers a variety of Knox licenses to support your device management needs. If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it. Purchase Knox commercial licenses from your local reseller. Server-based licenses Server-based licenses include both cloud and on-premises services. Enter cloud license keys on the Knox Admin Portal, and enter on-premises license keys directly on the service console.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

If your Knox Platform for Enterprise license is about to expire within the next 90 days, make sure to renew the license for another two years. Otherwise, your existing devices will be impacted.

As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

            "content": "Feature Summary. For those wanting a quick reference to the security, manageability, and advanced VPN\"features offered by Samsung Knox devices, review the summary below. For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

            "content": "Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps.

With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain.

They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

Not only can IT admins have real-time access to what the remote device screen is displaying, but also control it by injecting actions such as finger, keyboard, and mouse events. Although other mobile platforms also offer remote viewing of remote device displays, only Knox provides built-in remote control of devices without requiring third-party solutions. Here is an example use case: An enterprise employee is on a business trip. On encountering a problem with the company-issued mobile phone, the employee contacts an enterprise IT\"admin. The IT\"admin uses an EMM console to remotely view the device screen to observe the issue first hand, then remotely controls the device, through finger, mouse, or keyboard actions. The IT\"admin directly accesses the environment to remotely debug the issue on the device.\"The employee is now quickly productive, without the frustrating downtime associated with relaying instructions verbally or through email. The continuous polling of the device screens doesn't impact device performance as devices send only screen changes. Unique advantages of Knox Remote Control The Knox Platform provides built-in remote control without requiring third-party solutions. For enterprises, this control: Saves time by enabling IT admins to troubleshoot remote mobile device issues in real-time. Reduces employee down-time and optimizes employee productivity through quick problem resolution.

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

After you successfully verify your Samsung account with the PIN sent to your email, you're redirected back to the Samsung Knox portal to complete your registration. Check that the details shown are correct, then click NEXT. 6. Fill in your company information, then click NEXT. 7. Review the Samsung Knox agreements, select the applicable boxes, then click SUBMIT.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to. Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account. Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service.

If your organization has devices enrolled in multiple Knox cloud services, the Knox Admin Portal offers a single, consolidated view that displays a device's details across all the services it's enrolled in. If you're a managed service provider admin, device and service info is limited to the customer you're currently managing. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, enter a device IMEI or serial number to view Knox service info for that device, shown as a centralized device info page. If the device you're searching for has two SIMs, you can enter either the primary or secondary IMEI to view its info. You can also navigate to this device view from the Device page in each individual service console by clicking View all device information. The centralized device info page displays the following: SERVICE - If the device is registered in a Knox cloud service and its user is invited to the service, the service name is shown. Click a service name to open the device's details on that service console and make updates to its info as required. Clicking a Knox Manage (KM) link opens that page on the KM console in a new browser tab. DEVICE STATUS - The last known enrollment status of the device, as reported by the service. Click a status to open a sliding panel containing additional device info. PROFILE - The profile assigned to the device, if applicable. Click a profile name to see details about the profile. For Knox E-FOTA, info about the assigned campaign is shown instead. DEVICE INFO - Service-specific info about the device. For example, if the service is KM, the device's associated user ID, organization, and/or group are shown. SERVICE END DATE - The date when the service or license expires. LAST SEEN - The date when the device last connected to the Knox cloud server. LAST MODIFIED - The date when changes were last pushed to the device. Delete a device from all Knox cloud services Admins with device management permissions for and access to all Knox cloud services can delete a device from all services with one action, instead of deleting it from each individual service. If a device uploaded from an EMM is deleted, and its EMM group is synced with Knox E-FOTA after deletion, the device will be added to Knox E-FOTA again. To delete a device from all services: 1. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, search for a device by its IMEI or serial number. 2. On the centralized device info page, click !Menu icon, then Delete device. You won't see this option if you don't have the right permissions. 3. If the device can be deleted from all the services it's enrolled in, you're prompted to confirm whether you want to continue with the device deletion. If so, click DELETE. If the device can't be deleted from one or more services, the reason for each service is shown in the popup. To proceed with the deletion, try again after you address each reason. If the deletion is successful, the device is deleted from all supported services in the Knox Admin Portal, including Knox Remote Support. If the deletion is only partially successful, you'll see a notification for each failed deletion with a downloadable CSV file containing more information.",

            "content": "Knox Admin Portal 21.09 release notes. Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Support for Samsung account login using Google SSO In this release, IT admins accessing the Knox Admin Portal through the direct console link can now sign in to their Samsung account using Google SSO. On the Samsung Account sign-in page, a Continue with Google button is available at the bottom of the screen. An IT admin can click this button to log in with their Google credentials and access the Knox Admin Portal. Okta SSO integration With 21.11, IT admins can set up Okta SSO to log in to SamsungKnox.com and the Knox Admin Portal. The three available SSO options are as follows: 1. Okta 2. Microsoft Azure AD 3. Ping Identity Please note that once Okta SSO is set up for a Knox cloud services tenant, its users can no longer log in to Knox services with their Samsung account credentials. See Configure Okta SSO settings for integration steps. Refreshed navigation sidebar The Knox Admin Portal navigation sidebar was refreshed for Knox cloud service 21.11.

For example, if you search for a device that's enrolled in Knox Manage, info about its associated user ID, organization, and/or group shows under DEVICE INFORMATION. Consolidated administrators and roles menu Previously, IT admins managed admins and their roles separately for each Knox cloud service. Now, the consolidated administrators page offers a single interface for select admins to manage secondary admins.

In this release, the Knox Remote Support feature is available in the Knox Admin Portal to all enterprise customers with a valid trial or commercial Knox Suite license.

This consolidated page is accessible from License in each service console and from the Licenses entry above Administrators & Roles in the Knox Admin Portal navigation pane.

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

Available on all Samsung Knox-compatible devices, the Knox warranty bit is a security feature that detects if unofficial software has been installed on your phone. This prevents malicious attempts to access your data. The Knox Warranty Bit, a one-time programmable bit e-fuse, detects if a non-Knox kernel is loaded on the device. The warranty bit has a value of \"0\" but changes to \"1\" if an older or unofficial Android build is installed on the device, indicating that the security of the Knox container has been compromised. If the Knox Warranty Bit has been tripped, the device is prevented from using Knox services. Resolution A tripped Knox Warranty Bit cannot be reverted, and Knox services will not work on the device. To restore functionality for KCS solutions, a hardware replacement of the device's Printed Board Assembly (PBA) is required. Troubleshooting If you see an error in the format below during the enrollment process, it typically indicates that the warranty bit has been blown. > [ENROLLMENT ERROR] because a custom OS is or has been installed on this device.

Using KDA, some administrators have reported that they are not able to enroll devices in more than one KCS. When adding a device in a second service (e.g. enrolling in Knox Mobile Enrollment after enrolling in Knox Configure), the following error message is shown: > The device is already enrolled. Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process. The NFC enrollment method will be deprecated from Android 11 onwards. Resolution Currently, KDA is only designed for use with one KCS service at a time.\"To avoid encountering issues with Bluetooth and NFC enrollment, please ensure you remove your device from any KCS services it is in before enrolling in another.

Although the support for the oldest version is no longer available on every first major release in the year, Knox solutions are supported on the latest five major Android versions. With this change, we commit to: 1. Maintain the best-in-class product quality by focusing our resources on the versions that majority of you use. 2. Enhance the security of Knox products by restricting the supported versions to recent ones that have valid security patches from OS or hardware. Exceptions , Knox Platform for Enterprise is supported from Knox 2.4 and each feature is dependent on the specific Knox version. Knox Manage is supported from seven major Android versions (6-12) as of March 2022. To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted.
