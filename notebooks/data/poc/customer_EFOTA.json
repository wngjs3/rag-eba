Test updates before deployment to verify compatibility between in-house apps and new OS versions, all while increasing the security of enterprise devices by ensuring the latest security patches are deployed on a schedule. Try for free Audience This document is intended for: System Security Architects - Understand how Knox E-FOTA works, and how you can use it to update fleets of enterprise devices. IT Admins - Learn to manage over-the-air updates for enterprise devices. Try the solution Streamline your mobile update workflow using Knox E-FOTA. Enable version control management, and deploy OS updates by setting updates to occur outside business hours to avoid disruptions to productivity. Start tutorial About Knox E-FOTA Knox E-FOTA\"is an enterprise solution that controls OS versions on Samsung mobile devices to maximize cost efficiency. It helps IT admins do the following: Ensure that the latest security patches are deployed to devices on schedule. Test updates before deployment, ensuring compatibility between in-house apps and new OS versions. Key Features , Forced updates - Simplify your device management experience by deploying forced updates so that all devices have the same OS version on every device. You can push updates without requiring user interaction. Selective OS\"version - The latest OS version isn't always compatible with your in-house apps. Ensure operational continuity by controlling which OS version to deploy to your devices. You can lock them to that version until you're ready to deploy the latest OS version. Scheduled updates - Minimize business interruptions by scheduling firmware updates to occur outside business hours. For a full list of all features, visit the product page for Knox E-FOTA. Benefits 1. Software compatibility testing - Only enforce updates once the software is tested to ensure compatibility between internal apps and new OS versions. This helps minimize the need for IT support for compatibility issues. 2. Device security - Deploy the latest verified firmware along with the latest security patches - also called Security Maintenance Releases (SMR) - to all corporate-liable devices immediately without requiring user interaction. 3. Efficient rollout - Maintain productivity by specifying a time when devices download and install updates to minimize business interruptions. IT admins can stagger the deployment of updates (for example, by region) to ensure operational continuity. 4. Efficient device management - Remotely deploying forced updates ensures that all enterprise devices are always running the latest validated OS version. Having a uniform view of all devices allows IT admins to manage them more efficiently. Silent updates do not require user interaction so they can't be postponed or rejected. How does Knox E-FOTA work? Firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) is a service that allows IT admins to efficiently and securely push firmware updates to a fleet of enterprise mobile devices. Typically, the latest firmware updates are pushed to devices by their service provider through a Samsung Business-To-Consumer (B2C) FOTA server. The problem with this is that the latest firmware isn't always compatible with a company's in-house apps. Without Knox E-FOTA, companies can only address this problem by doing the following: Always update to the latest OS version, Block all OS updates using their EMM Knox E-FOTA\"allows admins to select a firmware version to deploy, even if it's not the latest version. Devices are then locked to that version. When admins have performed compatibility testing on a later firmware version, they can then update devices to the tested version. With Knox E-FOTA, businesses push firmware updates from a Samsung Business-To-Business (B2B) FOTA\"server There are exceptions, such as AT&T and Verizon, which provide firmware updates from their own servers and not through Samsung's Knox E-FOTA service. The B2B FOTA server then syncs the device information with the B2C FOTA server. #Downloading firmware versions Knox E-FOTA gives you access to a list of official firmware released via the general Samsung FOTA service within the last 12 months. An additional firmware list could be provided following an extra consultation. When pushing a firmware update, Samsung generates a delta file or a change file for updating from the current firmware version to a target version. This is then released via the general Samsung FOTA server and delivered to enterprise devices over-the-air. Firmware files are available from the Knox E-FOTA server for an average of 12 months. In some cases, especially when upgrading devices to a major Android OS version, you may be required to download several delta files to reach the target firmware version. On Knox E-FOTA\"Advanced, this means you may need to run several campaigns incrementally to reach a target version. On Knox E-FOTA and\"Knox E-FOTA\"on MDM, only one campaign is needed; the required delta files are sequentially installed automatically. Regardless of which Knox E-FOTA edition you're using, this will result in devices rebooting multiple times. Compare the Knox E-FOTA editions There are three editions available for the Knox E-FOTA service: Knox E-FOTA, Knox E-FOTA\"Advanced, Knox E-FOTA on MDM This section describes their key differentiating features. Feature Knox E-FOTA on MDM Knox E-FOTA Advanced Knox E-FOTA Description Selective OS version \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Select an OS version to be deployed to the devices, and prevent updates to OS versions that have not been verified with internal apps.

            "content": "About EMM groups. Describes how Knox E-FOTA allows you to sync device groups from your EMM. With Knox E-FOTA, you can streamline your device management tasks by syncing device groups from your EMM. Connecting Knox E-FOTA to your EMM helps ensure that your device groups are never out of sync. Device information is managed in the EMM so that the Knox E-FOTA admin doesn't have to do it manually. The device groups that you add are automatically synced from the EMM periodically every 24 hours. The following rules apply for devices you add from an EMM: Any device added to a device group in the EMM is automatically added to that device group in Knox E-FOTA. When you assign a campaign to an EMM device group, this campaign is automatically set as the default campaign for the group. This default campaign is assigned only to devices in the group when they are synced from the EMM for the first time. After the first sync, existing devices synced from EMM groups won't be assigned the default campaign when you sync from the EMM again. The default campaign associated with these devices changes if their EMM group or EMM group priority changes. Note that these devices are not automatically assigned to the changed default campaign. Any device deleted from the EMM group is still available on Knox E-FOTA. Only the device's EMM group information is deleted. The campaign, license, and upload source information are still accessible. Additionally, you can individually manage devices synced in EMM groups without the need to unenroll these devices from the group and re-enroll them, simplifying device management for enterprises. You can also click the EMM group name to perform all the actions that you can perform on the Devices tab on the Devices page. You can connect to up to five different EMM instances, which can be of the same EMM vendor or different EMM vendors. The Knox E-FOTA web console identifies the different EMM instances, which you can selectively synchronize groups with, desynchronize groups with, or remove entirely. Supported EMMs The following are the supported EMMs: Blackberry, IBM, Knox Manage, Microsoft Intune, MobileIron, SOTI, VMware Topics in this section Section Description Prerequisites for connecting to Knox Manage Prerequisite for connecting to VMware Prerequisites for connecting to Microsoft Intune Perform the prerequisite procedure to obtain authentication information from the EMM.

Once you clear the search, the switch transitions back to Sync all groups. Search and add a maximum of 1,000 device groups for syncing without triggering a warning. Enroll devices by EMM group Perform this procedure if you want to enroll one or more device groups to Knox E-FOTA. This means that all devices in the device groups you select will be enrolled. 1. In the EMM groups tab, select the device groups you want to enroll. 2. Click Actions > Enroll devices in groups. The Select license pop-up shows the active licenses that have enough seats to accommodate all devices in your selected device group(s). If you want to see all licenses, click Clear Filters. 3. Select the license you want to use, and click Done. Assign a device group to a campaign Perform this procedure if you want to assign all devices in a device group to a campaign. 1. In the EMM groups tab, select the device groups you want to assign to a campaign. 2. Click Actions > Assign campaign. The Select campaign pop-up shows only the active and scheduled campaigns. If you want to see all campaigns (including expired ones), click Clear Filters. The Select license pop-up shows the active licenses that have enough seats to accommodate all devices in your selected device group(s). If you want to see all licenses, click Clear Filters. 3. Select the campaign to assign, and click Done. #Default campaigns When you assign a campaign to an EMM device group, this campaign is automatically set as the default campaign for the group. This default campaign is then assigned only to devices in this group when they're synced from the EMM for the first time. These synced devices exhibit the following properties: The default campaign associated with these devices changes if their EMM group or EMM group priority changes. Note that these devices are not automatically assigned to the changed default campaign. After the first sync, existing devices synced from EMM groups won't be assigned the default campaign when you sync from the EMM again. You can assign the default campaign to these devices, regardless of whether they were uploaded by a reseller or in bulk using a CSV file. You can also find information about the default campaign by selecting an EMM group on the EMM groups page. Manage group priority Managing group priority is useful in cases where a device is included in multiple EMM groups. Assigning group priority allows you to specify which device group takes precedence in the event of a campaign conflict. For example, device A is in both group1 and group2. If group1 is assigned to campaign1 and group2 is assigned to campaign2, which campaign is device A assigned to? The answer depends on which group has a higher priority. To manage group priority: 1. On the EMM groups page: Click Actions > Manage group priority, or , Click Manage all group priority. 2. Click one or more groups and reassign their priority using the upward or downward arrow. 3. Optionally click Move to Top or Move to Bottom on the top right to reassign the priority of one or more groups in one swift action. 4. Click Update groups priority. EMM group auto-sync As an IT admin, you can configure Knox E-FOTA to automatically sync any changes made to EMM groups. To do so, on the EMM groups tab: 1. Switch on the Auto-sync switch to immediately send a group sync request to your EMM. 2. Switch off the Auto-sync switch to disable the auto-sync process. EMM groups are no longer updated based on the pre-defined sync interval. Moreover, the Auto-sync switch is switched off by default. The EMM group information is updated automatically, based on the sync interval shown beside the Next sync field. The interval defaults to 24 hours. If the group sync is pending or if it fails, the switch is switched off and you must manually switch it on again to enable auto-sync. You can't manually sync EMM groups until the current EMM group syncing process is complete. During this process, the Sync now action becomes unavailable and temporarily transitions to Syncing status. Additionally, the Status column also temporarily transitions to Syncing. EMM re-authentication A banner at the top of your Knox E-FOTA console notifies you when devices fail to sync with the EMM. To reconnect them with the EMM: 1. Reset your client secret on the EMM console. 2. Click RECONNECT in the banner at the top of your Knox E-FOTA console. 3. Enter your new client secret to connect with your EMM, then click CONNECT AND SYNC DEVICES. Also, as an IT admin, you can update your EMM connection credentials anytime: 1. On the EMM groups page, click Actions > Reconnect EMM > Click Connect if all the details are correct. Doing so initiates the EMM reconnection. 2. A toast notification confirms the outcome of the reconnection. Available only to IT admins with EMM reconnection permissions. Policies to prevent accidental status changes when syncing from an EMM Knox E-FOTA follows the following policies to ensure that any device you add individually is properly managed if you later sync that device through an EMM group: Deleting a device from your EMM console does not delete it from the Knox E-FOTA console. Only the group information is removed, while campaign, license, and upload source information is kept. You can manually delete these devices on the Devices tab or through a CSV file upload. 1. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then add its device group from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, that device will keep its current status until the EMM group's initial status changes from Synced to something else. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1. When you add Group 1 to Knox E-FOTA, it will get the status Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status. 2. When an EMM group's status changes from the initial Synced status to something else, all its members will follow the new status. Example: Continuing the example above - if you assign Group 1 to Campaign B, all its members, including Device A, will also be assigned to Campaign B. 3. If an EMM group is explicitly unenrolled, all its members will also be unenrolled. Example: Continuing the example above - if you unenroll Group 1, all its members, including Device A, will also be unenrolled. 4. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then add its device groups (multiple groups) from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, the device will follow the policy of the group with the higher priority. Group priority is set in Knox E-FOTA. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1 and Group 2. When you add Group 1 and Group 2 to Knox E-FOTA, they will both get the initial status, Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status (following the first policy above). In this example, Group 1 has a higher priority than Group 2, so Device A will follow Group 1's policy. If you enroll Group 2 and assign it to Campaign B, Device A is unaffected. Since Group 1 is still in its initial Synced status, Device A will continue to retain its Assigned status. When you enroll Group 1 and assign it to Campaign C, Device A will also be assigned to Campaign C (following the second policy above).",

For device models that are newly added to the Knox E-FOTA service, it may take a few hours to for the list of applicable firmware versions to become available. If you do not see the firmware list for a device model you've just added, try again in a few hours. If Knox E-FOTA is in the process of syncing the firmware list for your assigned devices, you'll have to wait until the firmware sync is complete. You'll receive an email notification when the firmware is ready to be used. If you purchased the Software Customization Services license, you can request custom firmware from a Samsung admin. Once you've received custom firmware from a Samsung admin, you'll find it in the Custom Firmware tab when selecting your target firmware. If you have purchased support for Enterprise Security Patches (ESP), you can select them as target firmware in the firmware list. 5. Click Create and Activate. A notification is displayed confirming that the campaign was created. The campaign is added to the Campaigns list. 6. (Optional) Set a gradual campaign rollout A gradual rollout means that, once the campaign begins, small batches of devices update their firmware every day, rather than the whole pool of devices on the first day. The campaign then continues to roll out updates progressively until all devices are updated by the campaign's end date. Such a gradual rollout can provide you the opportunity to troubleshoot issues with firmware rollout as they arise, so that erroneous or vulnerable patches aren't immediately propagated to all devices at once. The rollout rate defines the size each device batch, meaning the number of devices that update each day. The rate is calculated as a percentage of the total device pool. In determining the rollout schedule, each device is given a random start date. For example, a rollout rate of 20% triggers firmware updates on 20% of the devices on the first day, the next 20% the day after, until, by the fifth day, 100% of the devices are updated. Gradual campaign rollout exhibits the following behavior: 1. Changes to either the rollout rate, target firmware version, or campaign status will reset the rollout start date of all assigned devices. 2. Rolling out a campaign to newly assigned devices doesn't reset the rollout start date of devices that were already assigned the campaign, preventing any delay in pushing firmware updates. A device that is off during this campaign period will have a pending status until the device is turned on. If the device remains off during the duration of the campaign period, it won't receive the command to update. In some cases, especially when upgrading devices to a major Android OS version, several firmware updates are installed incrementally to reach the target firmware version, even if you only applied one campaign. This process results in devices automatically rebooting multiple times, corresponding to the number of firmware updates that actually occurred. Assign devices to an existing campaign You can assign devices to an existing campaign: 1. Go to Devices. 2. Select the devices you want to assign. 3. Click ACTIONS > Assign campaign. 4. Select which campaign to assign the devices to. 5. Click ASSIGN.",

To successfully enroll devices in Knox E-FOTA, you must first install and launch the Knox E-FOTA client app on your devices. The client allows Knox E-FOTA to manage the device. It functions as an agent that connects the device to the Knox E-FOTA server. For legacy OneUI Core devices, install the Knox E-FOTA: Legacy OneUI Core app instead. For more information, see Install the Knox Knox E-FOTA: Legacy OneUI Core app. This section describes several ways to install the Knox E-FOTA client on devices: Manually install and launch the client , Through Play Store , Through a download link , Automatically install and launch the client , Install the client through your EMM , Through the Knox Service Plugin , Through managed Google Play , Through the EMM as an internal app , Install the client through Knox Configure , Notify device users to install the client , Through Play Store , Through a download link , When the client app is installed, it proceeds to provision the device. The app typically prompts the user to read and accept the privacy policy. If you want the client app to skip this step during device provisioning, you can update the privacy policy setting in the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. Click your account icon and select Privacy policy setting. Only a user with a Super Admin role can perform this action. If your device is managed by an EMM, you can install the Knox E-FOTA app through managed Google Play or Knox Service Plugin. To prevent the Knox E-FOTA app from being uninstalled by an EMM policy, approve the Knox E-FOTA app through managed Google Play. If you use an app allowlist policy in Knox Configure or your EMM, you must add the following Knox E-FOTA client packages to the allowlist. `com.samsung.android.knox.efota` - For both OneUI and the latest OneUI Core devices , `com.samsung.android.knox.core.efota` - For legacy OneUI Core devices , `com.samsung.android.knox.efota.plugin` - For all devices Manually install and launch the client app These procedures are useful if you're testing how Knox E-FOTA works and you want to install the client on just a few devices. #Install the client through Play Store 1. On the device, launch Play Store. 2. Search for the Knox E-FOTA client app. 3. Follow the prompts to install the app. 4. Launch the app. #Install the client through a download link 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. In the left sidebar, click Knox E-FOTA. 2. Go to Devices > All Devices. 3. Click Direct Download. 4. In the Direct Download popup, copy the download link for the APK file. You can also copy the sample message and send it through email or SMS to your devices. 5. On each device, download, install, and launch the app: 1. Tap Download > Open File > Install. The client app installs. 2. Tap Open to launch the app. Automatically install and launch the client after unboxing Out-of-box-experience (OOBE) installation is the process of automatically installing the Knox E-FOTA app to a device after the device's initial setup (after unboxing or factory resetting the device). OOBE enrollment only installs the Knox E-FOTA app if all of these conditions are satisfied: The device was uploaded by a reselle, A valid campaign is assigned to the device, A valid license is available Campaigns are valid as long as they aren't test/local campaigns and the campaign status isn't Cancelled. Both trial and commercial licenses are valid as long as they are active. Once the conditions have been met, the Knox E-FOTA app is automatically installed on devices through OOBE if you follow this workflow: 1. You purchase the devices through a Knox reseller that is enrolled in the Knox Deployment Program. The devices must be running Android 9 or higher. 2. The reseller uploads the devices under your customer ID through KDP. 3. You approve the reseller's device upload. 4. Create and assign a campaign to the devices you want to enroll in E-FOTA through OOBE. 5. Ensure that you have a valid license. When you turn the devices on, they are verified. The Knox E-FOTA app is then automatically installed and launched on them. You can streamline the user experience further by auto-enrolling and auto-assigning devices that a reseller uploads. #Install the EMM client and the Knox E-FOTA app on an unboxed device through OOBE If your new device has been unboxed and you want to install the EMM's client app and the Knox E-FOTA app through OOBE: 1. Ask your reseller to upload the device under your customer ID. 2. Use Knox Mobile Enrollment to configure the profile for the device. This automatically installs your EMM's client app on your device through OOBE. 3. Enroll the device in Knox E-FOTA. The Knox E-FOTA app will be downloaded and installed through OOBE. To prevent the Knox E-FOTA app from being uninstalled by an EMM policy, approve the Knox E-FOTA app through managed Google Play. The Knox E-FOTA app will not be automatically installed through OOBE if kiosk mode is enabled on the device by an EMM policy. Install the client through your EMM The following procedures describe how you can push the Knox E-FOTA app to devices through your (EMM). Install and launch the client through the Knox Service Plugin, Install the client through managed Google Play, Install the client through the EMM as an internal app #Install and launch the client through Knox Service Plugin You can use Knox Service Plugin (KSP) to install the Knox E-FOTA client app. 1. Set up KSP on your EMM console. See the Knox Service Plugin admin guide for information on how you can do this on the most common EMMs. 2. On your EMM's admin console, go to the Knox Service Plugin settings. 3. Under Device-wide policies (Device Owner), enable Enable device policy controls. 4. Under Device-wide policies (Device Owner) > Firmware update (FOTA) policy enable the following KSP policies: Enable firmware controls , Enable E-FOTA client installation & launch In the following example, the Knox Manage console is configured to enable these settings. 5. Enroll your device to your EMM in DO mode: 1. Unbox the device if it is brand new. If it is not brand new, perform a factory reset. You are prompted to run the setup wizard. 2. Follow the device setup wizard. When you're prompted to enter a Google email or phone number, enter the DPC identifier. The DPC identifier differs depending on the EMM you're using, but it typically starts with afw#. There are several other ways to enroll devices in DO mode. For example, you can use Knox Mobile Enrollment or Zero-touch enrollment. The EMM app is installed. The user is prompted to sign in to complete enrollment. The EMM app automatically installs the KSP client app. In turn, the KSP app installs and launches the Knox E-FOTA client app. #Install the client through managed Google Play If your EMM supports the following functionality through managed Google play, you can approve the Knox E-FOTA app, push the app to your devices, and launch the app on those devices. App installation (DO), Remote app launch The general workflow is as follows: 1. Sign in to your EMM. 2. Use your EMM's search functionality to search for the Knox E-FOTA app in managed Google Play. 3. From the search results, select the Knox E-FOTA app and approve it. 4. Configure the EMM such that: It automatically installs the app on devices. It automatically launches the app after installation. 5. Assign the app to the devices that you plan to enroll in Knox E-FOTA. If your EMM has the capability to automatically launch the client, we strongly recommend you enable it. Enrollment can't complete until the client launches on the device. For detailed information, refer to your EMM's documentation. #Install the client through your EMM as an internal app If you use an EMM that has an app installation functionality, you may be able to use your EMM's console to push the client app to your devices. For general information on how to push an app to devices through various EMMs, see Install an app to devices through an EMM. If your EMM has the capability to automatically launch the client, we strongly recommend you enable it. Enrollment can't complete until the client launches on the device. If you want to block the firmware update before the Knox E-FOTA client installation, you should disable the firmware update policy of the device on your EMM portal. See Block non-mainline firmware updates for more information. Install and launch the client through Knox Configure With Knox Configure, you can create a profile, upload the client app, add the client app to the profile, and assign the profile to your devices.

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA On-Premises 22.04 Updates to password hash algorithm Previously, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises used the bcrypt password hash algorithm. Starting with this release, passwords are now hashed with the PBKDF2 algorithm to offer more flexible password security measures for high-security enterprises. Benefits of the PBKDF2 algorithm include: Longer salt length and key length - 128 bits or highe, Higher key iteration count - 10,000 or highe, Lightweight pseudorandom function (PRF) - HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA512 Password length configuration To comply with enterprise security regulations, Samsung installation engineers can now set a minimum and maximum length for user passwords. By default, the minimum password length is set to 8 characters, and the maximum is set to 12. The minimum password length that an installation engineer can set is 8-20 characters. The maximum length can be 12-30 characters. Existing user passwords are not affected by this change. However, when an old password is updated, the new password must conform to the current policy.

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA On-Premises 23.04 Improvements to the Knox E-FOTA firmware downloader To reduce the number of firmware versions you need to download for your on-premises server, the Knox E-FOTA firmware downloader now allows you to select target firmware versions to download for your on-premises server. The latest list of available firmware versions can be obtained as a input.json file from the Knox Admin Portal homepage. You can browse for this file in the firmware downloader, as well as a scenario.json file containing the current firmware versions of your enrolled devices. After uploading these two files, you can then select specific firmware versions for download. Note that if your PC is behind a proxy server, you also need to enter your proxy server host IP and port before you can download the firmware. Support for a certificate password field in configuration file The Knox E-FOTA On-Premises agent now allows you to input required passwords through an additional field in the efota_config file. If you're familiar with the Android API, you can also add an Android intent listener to define the password. See Step 1 - Download and install the agent app for more details. Improvements to service performance Starting with the 23.04 release, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises now automatically evenly polls device groups for updates. If you allocated a maximum bandwidth per device in the campaign policy, the agent ensures it meets the download speed limit by stopping and starting the firmware download as needed. Enhancements to bulk device deletion Previously, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises didn't require additional confirmation from you when bulk deleting devices. With the 23.04 release, when you delete devices in bulk, a dialog asks you to confirm before the operation begins. Enhancements to device tags Prior to the 23.04 release, Knox E-FOTA On-Premises only supported device tags up to 10 characters long. When the maximum device tag length was reached, no error message would display in the console. To allow for easier differentiation between devices, device tags up to 45 characters long are now supported. Tag limitations are also dynamically shown as you enter the device tag - for example, an error message notifies you when you enter a tag 46 characters long. Back to release notes",

Knox Suite features in Knox E-FOTA are now available Knox Suite is a bundled offering introduced this month that allows you to use the premium features of the following services: Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Platform for Enterprise (through the Knox Service Plugin) You can access all included Knox services with a single Knox Suite license. The following features were added in Knox E-FOTA to support Knox Suite features: The License details popup and the Licenses table now show the remaining number of seats in your license. For a Knox Suite license key, this number is calculated based on the number of seats consumed from all Knox services that use this license. When a device is enrolled in multiple Knox services under the same license key, that device only consumes 1 license seat. For example: License 1 has 30 seats , Device A and B are enrolled in Knox Manage under License 1 , Device B and C are enrolled in Knox E-FOTA under License 1 In this case, you'll see the following resulting values in the License details popup and the Licenses table: Purchased: 30 , Assigned: 2 - Because only two devices are enrolled in Knox E-FOTA , Remaining: 27 - Because three seats were actually consumed across all Knox services. Tooltips were also added in the License details popup and the Licenses table to provide guidance on Knox Suite license usage. A user can now have up to two trial licenses in Knox E-FOTA - one for Knox Suite and one for Knox E-FOTA. For more information on Knox Suite operations, see the Knox Suite Admin Guide. Knox E-FOTA client installation through managed Google Play #Through Knox Service Plugin You can now use the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) to remotely install the Knox E-FOTA client on your enterprise devices. Your EMM must be configured to use KSP. For more information, see Install the client app through KSP. The Knox E-FOTA app is now available in managed Google Play. If your EMM supports the following functionality through managed Google play, you can use managed Google Play to approve the Knox E-FOTA app, push the app to your devices, and launch the app on those devices. App installation (DO), Remote app launch Customizable postpone policy #Enhancements in the admin portal In order to give device users control over firmware updates, an enhancement was made in the postpone policy of new campaigns. When creating a campaign or a test campaign, you can now specify a postpone duration - the length of time it will take before the next firmware update reminder appears. You can also set a timer; if the user fails to act on an update reminder before the timer times out, the update is automatically installed. Previously, the postpone duration was fixed to 30 minutes and the timer was fixed to 30 seconds. A legacy campaign (that is, a campaign created before this release) will continue to have this postpone policy. However, when you edit a legacy campaign, you are presented with the customizable postpone settings. The new value ranges of the postpone settings are as follows: Postpone duration - 1 to 24 hours, Auto-install timer - 5 to 60 minutes #Enhancements in the client app The device now shows the remaining time in the timer (in seconds) before the firmware update begins. This allows the user to react (if needed) to postpone update. If they click Later, they see how long (in hours) before they'll be reminded again.

Support for Microsoft Intune With Knox E-FOTA, you can add device groups from a supported EMM, and then perform firmware management on those device groups. Device group information is regularly synced from your EMM. In this release, support has been added for Microsoft Intune. You can now connect to Intune through your Knox E-FOTA admin portal, select device groups to add, and perform operations on those devices. The following are examples of operations you can perform: Enroll devices in groups, Assign a campaign to device groups, Push a campaign to device groups, Manage group priority For more information, see Prerequisites for connecting to Microsoft Intune. Knox E-FOTA client installation through Knox Service Plugin You can now use the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) to remotely install the Knox E-FOTA client on enterprise devices. To do this, you must configure your EMM to use KSP. For more information, see Install the client app through Knox Service Plugin Firmware management for AT&T and Verizon Wireless users You can now use Knox E-FOTA to manage firmware on AT&T (ATT) and Verizon Wireless (VZW) devices. This simplifies your workflow because you can now manage the firmware of all your organization's devices in one place. ATT and VZW use their own dedicated FOTA infrastructure. Firmware sync notification If you attempt to configure a new device model while Knox E-FOTA is in the process of syncing its firmware, the admin portal now shows that a firmware sync is in progress. When syncing is complete, you'll receive an email notification that the firmware for that model is ready to be used. Enhancements to the firmware list Enhancements were made to the firmware list table to make it easier for you to find the firmware version you want to assign to a campaign: You can now sort the firmware list by Android OS version. In this case, firmware versions with the same Android version are first grouped together. In each group, firmware versions are sorted from the latest version to the earliest. The header row of the firmware table is now fixed so that it's always visible even when you scroll to the bottom of the table. Enhancements to the dashboard The following enhancements were made to the dashboard: #Device Status This widget shows the total counts of devices that fall under the following categories: Attention - These devices require the IT admin or device user to take action. For example, device enrollment is pending, the device failed to enroll, and so on. Cancelled - The IT admin canceled a firmware update. These devices have not yet been reassigned to other campaigns. Pending - These devices have been uploaded to the admin portal but have not been approved by the IT admin. Not enrolled - These devices have already been uploaded to the admin portal. They don't consume license seats for one of the following reasons: The Knox E-FOTA client app has not been installed yet. These were enrolled devices that the IT admin has attempted to unenroll or delete. However, the unenrollment process is not yet complete. Active - These devices are up to date and no operations are pending. If they click on a particular device status, they'll get more detailed information about the devices with that status. The dashboard also shows when the device counts were last updated. #OS Trend Graph The OS Trend Graph has been added. It shows a pie chart of the different OS versions of all enrolled devices. The chart includes a device count for each OS version. Clicking on a particular device count displays the device list filtered by the corresponding OS version. Activity log You can now view or download the activity log, which shows the activities that were performed in the Knox E-FOTA admin portal and who did them. Activities are logged for all areas of the admin portal: Device, Campaign, License, Reselle, EMM, Admin, Role For more information, see View or download the activity log. Support for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer You can now access the Knox E-FOTA admin portal through Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. #Supported versions Browse Version Microsoft Edge 40 41 42 44 (Optimized) 79 80 81 (Optimized) Internet Explorer 11 (Optimized) #Recommended portal screen resolution 1920 X 1080 Enhancement to the Knox E-FOTA card in the SamsungKnox.com dashboard Previously, if a Sub Admin attempted to join Knox E-FOTA before their Super Admin signed up for it, the Sub Admin would see a screen stating they have no access to the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. Starting this release, if a Super Admin has not signed up for Knox E-FOTA, the Sub Admins will not see the Knox E-FOTA card, and will therefore be unable to attempt to join it.

Support for additional EMMs Support has been added for the Blackberry and SOTI EMMs. You can now connect to Blackberry or SOTI through your Knox E-FOTA admin portal, select device groups to add, and perform operations on those devices. #Support for Blackberry You can now add user groups from Blackberry. In Knox E-FOTA, these groups are treated as groups of devices, not groups of users. For information on how to get started on connecting Knox E-FOTA to Blackberry, see Prerequisites for connecting to Blackberry. Adding shared device groups from Blackberry is not supported at this time. #Support for SOTI You can now add device groups from SOTI. In SOTI, device groups can be arranged in hierarchies. That is, a device can belong to a group, and that group can in turn have a parent group. When you add a device from SOTI to Knox E-FOTA, you only get information about the device group that device directly belongs to. For information on how to get started on connecting Knox E-FOTA to SOTI, see Prerequisites for connecting to SOTI. Adding virtual device groups from SOTI is not supported at this time. Automatically pushing the latest firmware version of a particular OS To prevent security vulnerabilities, you can now configure a campaign such that it automatically pushes the latest firmware version of a particular OS to the assigned devices. When choosing the latest firmware, you can specify: Any - The latest firmware, regardless of its OS version, will be pushed to devices. Up to - The latest firmware, within a particular OS version, will be pushed to devices. If you select this, you may not receive security patches included in the latest firmware of the latest OS version. If no firmware that meets your criteria is available for devices of a particular model-carrier pair, an error is displayed. In this case, you can lock the devices to their current firmware version. Monitoring active campaigns through the Dashboard You can now check the operation status of active campaigns through the Dashboard. This allows you to easily get an overall view of how your campaigns are operating. When a campaign goes into Active state, a widget for it is automatically added to the Dashboard. You can hide that widget by clicking the X icon on it. You can also manually re-pin it to your Dashboard, as long as it's still in Active state. What data is provided regarding the active campaign? For each active campaign, the widget has two views. The Status view shows the following: Success rate , Successful - Count of devices that were successfully processed. This also includes devices that were not updated because they have a higher version than the target firmware. Attention - Count of devices that require your attention. That is, the update failed on these devices or triggered an error. When you click this, the Devices list is displayed, filtered to show the devices that need your action. In-progress - Count of devices that have yet to download or install updates. The Status view is updated in real time. The Trend view shows the success rate of the campaign over time. This view is updated once a day. Campaigns that were activated before this release will not have the trend view. Sharing a commercial license key between US and EU tenants A Super Admin can now use the same commercial license in two tenants - one US tenant and one EU tenant. This is helpful if they're syncing US and EU devices from Knox Manage to Knox E-FOTA. The US devices will be registered in the US tenant, and the EU devices will be registered in the EU tenant. That license key (registered in both tenants) can then be used to enroll the devices synced from the EMM. A license key can only be shared between 1 US tenant and 1 EU tenant. Preventing accidental unenrollment when syncing from an EMM Previously, if you had a device that was enrolled in Knox E-FOTA and you subsequently added a device group from your EMM that also contained that device, that device would lose its current status; it would get the initial status of the newly added group: Synced. The following policies have been added to avoid situations like this. 1. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then subsequently add its device group from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, that device will keep its current status until the EMM group's initial status changes from Synced to something else. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1. When you add Group 1 to Knox E-FOTA, it will get the status Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status. 2. When an EMM group's status changes from the initial Synced status into something else, all its members will follow the new status. Example: Continuing the example above - if you assign Group 1 to Campaign B, all its members, including Device A, will also be assigned to Campaign B. 3. If an EMM group is explicitly unenrolled, all its members will also be unenrolled. Example: Continuing the example above - if you unenroll Group 1, all its members, including Device A, will also be unenrolled. 4. When you add a device to Knox E-FOTA and then subsequently add its device groups (multiple groups) from an EMM to Knox E-FOTA, the device will follow the policy of the group with the higher priority. Group priority is set in Knox E-FOTA. Example: You enrolled Device A to Knox E-FOTA and assigned it to Campaign A. On the EMM side, Device A is also a member of Group 1 and Group 2. When you add Group 1 and Group 2 to Knox E-FOTA, they will both get the initial status, Synced. Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status (following the first policy above). In this example, Group 1 has a higher priority than Group 2, so Device A will follow Group 1's policy. If you enroll Group 2 and assign it to Campaign B, this change will not affect Device A. Since Group 1 is still in its initial Synced status, Device A will continue to retain its Assigned status. When you enroll Group 1 and assign it to Campaign C, Device A will also be assigned to Campaign C (following the second policy above). Change in number of seats in the Knox E-FOTA trial license Starting this release, the number of seats that come with a Knox E-FOTA trial license will change from 100 to 30. The trial keys of all Knox Cloud Services will have 30 seats for 3 months. Improvement in firmware download speed Firmware updates are now served through a content delivery network (CDN). This results in faster download speeds. Firmware notification emails temporarily stopped Knox E-FOTA has temporarily stopped sending firmware notification emails. We will enhance this feature and add it back at a later date. Client improvement An improvement was made in the way the Knox E-FOTA client app manages downloads of firmware updates. UX improvements The following enhancements to the user interface were made. #Devices with expired licenses The following enhancements were made for devices with an expired license: If an enrolled device's license expires, the device remains in Enrolled state. However, no campaign can be assigned to it. An icon and a tooltip will be visible explaining why the device cannot be enrolled. If a device is in Enrollment pending state and its license expires, the device's status changes to Failed to enroll. An error is logged for this event. #Permission exceptions When you attempt to perform an action that you don't have permission to perform, the admin portal will now display a clearly worded error message explaining that you don't have permission to perform that action. #Administrators & Roles In Administrators & Roles > Roles, a link to the Knox E-FOTA Admin Guide has been added. The page being referenced includes information on each role and its corresponding permissions. #Link to Knox E-FOTA page on managed Google Play To facilitate the deployment of the Knox E-FOTA app to devices through managed Google Play, the following button has been added in Devices > All Devices. Clicking this button opens a page with a link to the Knox E-FOTA page in managed Google Play. Back to release notes",

Service improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA service. #Support for One UI Core devices The Knox E-FOTA for One UI Core app is now available to support One UI Core devices. This app can be installed through the following: Out-of-box experience (OOBE) - This is applicable only to devices running Android P or later that were uploaded to Knox E-FOTA by a Knox reseller. Play Store or managed Google Play - If you have a mix of One UI and One UI Core devices, you can add both the Knox E-FOTA app and the Knox E-FOTA for One UI Core app to managed Google Play through your EMM console. Otherwise, you only need to add the proper app. Play Store or managed Google Play will install the appropriate app based on the type of device. That is: The Knox E-FOTA app will be installed on One UI devices. The Knox E-FOTA for One UI Core app will be installed on One UI Core devices. Samsung's content delivery network - Direct download URL. Knox Service Plugin (KSP) - This feature is available starting from KSP's R18 release. For a list of all devices running One UI Core, see Samsung devices with One UI Core UI Platform. Knox E-FOTA requires devices to run Android N or later. #Improved onboarding workflow for Knox Suite Knox Suite is a bundled offering that includes the following Knox services: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA An enterprise enrolled in Knox Suite can use all of these Knox services through a single license key. Previously, an IT admin that signed up for Knox Suite needed to be approved for each Knox service separately. In this release, the onboarding workflow for some of the Knox services was consolidated to expedite the approval process. This allows IT admins to get started immediately on using the Knox services. The following scenarios demonstrate three possible Knox Suite onboarding workflows: Scenario 1 - You are not registered in any Knox service and you register for Knox Suite. 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. Knox E-FOTA and Knox Mobile Enrollment are always approved together. That is, if you're approved for access to one of these, you're automatically approved to use the other. 3. If you're also approved for access to Knox Manage, a Knox Suite trial license key is generated and injected into your Knox Manage and Knox E-FOTA accounts. 4. You will receive emails confirming that your application was approved. Scenario 2 - You are already registered in a Knox cloud service (Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, or Knox Configure) and you register for Knox Suite. 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. You are automatically approved for access to Knox E-FOTA and Knox Mobile Enrollment. 3. If you're also approved for access to Knox Manage, a Knox Suite trial license key is generated and injected into your Knox Manage and Knox E-FOTA accounts. 4. You will receive emails confirming that your application was approved. Scenario 3 - You register for Knox Suite but are denied access to one of the Knox services 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. You can still be approved for the other services that have not denied you access. Separate approval or rejection emails will be sent for the other services. 3. A Knox Suite trial license key is not generated. #Firmware notification emails Whenever a new firmware becomes available that is compatible to your registered devices, your Super Admins and Sub Admins, who have permission to manage the impacted devices, will receive an email notification. It contains the following details: Impacted device models (model and sales code pair), Firmware version, Security patch update, OS version, Details on what's new in the firmware In cases where multiple firmware deltas were added (for the same target version or for different target versions), only one email notification is sent. We encourage you to sign in to Knox E-FOTA to view and manage your firmware. Knox E-FOTA admin portal improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. #Accessing how-to videos related to Knox E-FOTA To facilitate learning about Knox E-FOTA, a link to Knox E-FOTA how-to videos has been added in the Feedback & Support tab of the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. #Syncing User groups and AD/LDAP groups from Knox Manage You can now sync user groups and AD/LDAP groups from Knox Manage. Previously, only device groups were supported. #Permission for Sub Admins to connect to or disconnect from an EMM Previously, only Super Admins had the permission to connect to an EMM or disconnect from it. Sub Admins can now perform this task. Thus, Super Admins and Sub Admins now have the same permissions with regard to managing Knox E-FOTA's integration with EMMs. #Admin portal UX improvements The following UX improvements were made on the Knox E-FOTA admin portal. ##Managing EMM groups The following improvements were made in the EMM groups tab: When managing EMM groups, all groups are now shown by default, including those you have not synced with Knox E-FOTA. This allows you to easily view and add other EMM groups. If you want to see only the groups you have already synced, select the Only show synced groups option above the EMM group list. The description in the Update device groups on E-FOTA screen was improved. When no changes have been made in the Update device groups on E-FOTA screen, the Update E-FOTA Groups button remains disabled. In the EMM groups tab, the possible statuses for each EMM group have changed as follows: Former status name , New status name - , - \\- , Synced Not enrolled , Group not enrolled Enrolled , Group enrolled Group assigned , Group assigned \\- , Expired , The Reconnect EMM option has been removed from the Action menu. When you disconnect the EMM from the Actions menu in the EMM groups tab, a popup appears, providing more descriptive information on how to unsync your synced groups and disconnect your EMM. A link to the Knox E-FOTA Admin Guide has been added to the Connect with your EMM screen. The documentation provides details on what you need to connect to your chosen EMM. ##Installing the Knox E-FOTA app through Knox Service Plugin To better educate admins on the many ways they can install the Knox E-FOTA client on devices, the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) button was added in Devices > All Devices. When clicked, the button launches a dialog box showing instructions on how to install the Knox E-FOTA client using an EMM that is set up with KSP. The dialog box also provides links to the following: Knox Service Plugin Admin Guide, How to set up KSP on different EMMs, How to configure your EMM to enable the installation of Knox E-FOTA through KSP Knox E-FOTA client improvements The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA client app. #Enhancements in error messages shown during enrollment To improve the user experience during device enrollment, error messages displayed by the device during enrollment have been made more descriptive. #Checking for app updates To ensure that updates to the Knox E-FOTA client are immediately installed on devices, the client app will automatically check for updates in the following events: After enrollment. When the client gets a push update. When the device user taps Check for campaign updates. When the app is launched. After booting the device and recovering a network connection. At each periodic poll (heartbeat), which occurs 24 hours after the last poll. #Client UX improvements The following UX enhancements were made to the Knox E-FOTA client: When the client downloads a firmware update, the download progress is now displayed. When the device does not have an active Internet connection through Wi-Fi, a notification is shown on the app. When creating a campaign, the IT admin sets preconditions that must be met before a device can start installing an update. Previously, if a device did not meet these preconditions, the client would check again after 30 minutes. In this release, this 30-minute interval was changed to 1 hour. Campaign updates The following enhancements were made in the Knox E-FOTA campaigns. #Installation conditions and error messages When a firmware installation fails, the user is now notified of the reason. The following are possible reasons: The user triggered the installation at a time that is outside the firmware installation time frame specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required charging status specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required battery level specified in the campaign. The device does not meet the required storage amount specified in the campaign. There is an incoming call. The firmware delta cannot be verified. #Local campaigns A local campaign is a firmware update that you deliver to your enterprise devices through your internal network. This allows you to reduce outgoing network load when pushing the campaign to devices. Local campaigns are useful when you expect devices to be in an environment with limited connectivity. ##Workflow The workflow to create local campaigns is as follows: 1. Request permission from Samsung to create local campaigns. When a Samsung admin grants you that permission, you can start working with local campaigns. 2. Create a local campaign, assign it to devices in Enrolled state in Knox E-FOTA, and select the target firmware to be deployed. When creating a local campaign, you specify the SFTP details of the local storage device that will host the firmware delta files. When the local campaign is created, the firmware deltas are sent to the local storage device. You will then receive an email containing the status of the file transmission, including the MD5 hash value of each delta file. 3. Copy the firmware deltas to the devices that need to be updated. 4. Use your EMM to create an intent that runs the firmware installation. Then, execute that intent. This causes the devices to start installing the firmware update. ##Unsupported operations The following operations are not supported: Assigning a local campaign to a device that is not in Enrolled state. Performing sequential updates. Only one delta update can be installed for each device in a local campaign. Assigning a local campaign to an EMM group. Setting a local campaign as a default campaign to be applied to devices uploaded by a reseller. Assigning a local campaign through a bulk action. Assigning a normal campaign to a device that has a local campaign assigned to it. Modifying the assigned devices in an active local campaign. Bug fixes The following bugs were resolved. #Syncing the status info of the client and server Enhancements were made to ensure that the server and client always show the same statuses. #Searching for the Knox E-FOTA app in Google Play Store on Wi-Fi-only devices Previously, Wi-Fi-only devices could not find the Knox E-FOTA app in the Google Play Store. This issue has been resolved. Back to release notes",

MobileIron cloud server: You can only sync device groups from the default space ( Global space ). When connecting to Knox E-FOTA, your GDPR (General Data Privacy Regulation) profile must not be enabled in the MobileIron console. If it is enabled, no data will be synced between MobileIron and Knox E-FOTA. Once connected, you must keep GDPR disabled. Otherwise, the next group sync may cause your synced devices to be removed from Knox E-FOTA. #Custom firmware If you purchased the Software Customization Services license, you can now receive custom firmware by requesting it from a Samsung admin. After you receive custom firmware from a Samsung admin, you can assign it to your campaigns the same way you assign normal firmware. When creating or editing a campaign, you can find the custom firmware listed in the Custom Firmware tab in the Select the target firmware screen. Knox E-FOTA admin portal improvements #Warning message for devices synced from an EMM In the Devices tab, when you select a device that was synced from an EMM, most operations in the Actions drop-down menu are disabled. A warning message appears stating that some actions cannot be performed in this tab. Most operations on such devices can only be done in the EMM groups tab. #Viewing the client app's version number The Device details screen now includes the version number ( Agent version ) of the Knox E-FOTA client installed on the device. #Monitoring license usage in the Dashboard You can now view your license usage in the Dashboard. The Licenses widget contains the following: A pie chart that shows the total license operation rate; that is, the total number of license seats currently assigned over the total number of license seats from all commercial and trial licenses in the account. A list of up to three licenses with the most number of seats in the account. For each license, the following details are shown: Type - Commercial or Trial. Status - Active, Registered (that is, the license has been added to the account but is not yet active), Expired, and Terminated. Operation rate - Number of assigned seats over the total number of seats in this license. End date - Date the license expires. To view a license's details, click on that license's name. The remaining number of seats from all commercial and trial licenses in the account. A View all link that takes you to the Licenses tab, which contains all licenses in the account and their details. #Dashboard with no data The following improvements were made to the Dashboard: If the account has no device data, a blank Device Status widget will be shown. If the account has a device but no campaigns, the Create Campaign button will appear on the Dashboard. If you click it, the Campaign information screen opens, where you can start creating a new campaign. If the account has a device but no license, a Get a License button will appear on the Dashboard. If you click it, a popup appears, where you can get a trial license or search for commercial license resellers. Back to release notes",

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 1.37 Knox E-FOTA #Group hierarchy information for devices synced from SOTI In SOTI, device groups can be arranged in hierarchies. That is, a device can belong to a group, and that group can in turn have a parent group. Previously, when adding a device from SOTI to Knox E-FOTA, the IT admin only received information about the device group that device directly belonged to. Starting this release, the Knox E-FOTA admin portal shows the hierarchical path of the devices so that IT admins can determine the hierarchical order of those devices in SOTI. Each device's full hierarchical path is shown in the Path field when they do the following: Add or update the devices groups from SOTI (Update device groups on E-FOTA screen), Visit the EMM groups tab. #Support for multi-CSC devices To aid IT admins in selecting the firmware versions that are appropriate for their devices, the CSC (Consumer Software Customization) info of each device is now available: When viewing devices in the Devices tab, the IT admin can customize the table columns to include each device's CSC. When the IT admin exports the device list to a CSV file, the CSC info is also included. When viewing a device's Device details, the IT admin can now see that device's CSC. When assigning target devices to a campaign, the IT admin fills in the Assign Devices and Firmware table in the campaign creation screen. Each row of that table represents a device group (a model/sales-code pair). The CSC of each device group is now pre-populated next to the sales code. For device groups that have multiple possible CSCs, a dropdown-menu is displayed instead, so that the IT admin can select the CSC for that group. When the IT admin moves on to select target firmware for a device group, they only see target firmware versions that are compatible with that device group given its model, sales code, and CSC. When creating, editing, and viewing a campaign, the IT admin can now see the CSCs of devices in that campaign. #Improved error pages The following error pages were modified to provide more guidance to users: 404 error page, 500 error page, 503 error page #Client agent version in exported device info When an IT admin downloads the device list as a CSV file, the CSV file will now contain the version of the Knox E-FOTA app installed on each device. This allows the IT admin to get a better insight into the status of their devices. #Deploying a firmware version based on a device's current firmware type This release note applies only to enterprises that purchased the Software Customization Services license and have custom firmware registered in Knox E-FOTA. When the IT admin creates a campaign and selects firmware to deploy, the system behaves as follows: If Then The IT admin selects Latest firmware for a particular group of devices. The latest firmware target is automatically defined as B2C or custom,depending on the current firmware type of that group of devices. The IT admin selects Select from firmware list for a particular group of devices1, and a custom firmware version is currently installed on that group. In the Select the target firmware screen that displays, only the Custom firmware tab is shown. This option prevents the IT admin from erroneously selecting normal firmware. The IT admin selects Select from firmware listfor a particular group of devices*, and a normal firmware version is currently installed on that group. In the Select the target firmware screen that displays, only normal firmware versions are shown. This option prevents the IT admin from erroneously selecting custom firmware. 1 A group of devices is defined as a combination of model, sales code, and CSC. It refers to a row in the Assign Devices and Firmware table shown in the campaign creation screen. #Forcing a client refresh IT admins can now push a client refresh to devices they select in the Devices tab. In the Actions menu, Force client refresh has been added. This new menu item is only enabled if all selected devices have the client app installed. When an IT admin selects this option, the following operations are performed: 1. The current campaign info is deleted. 2. The Knox E-FOTA app is updated to the latest version. 3. The latest campaign info is synced, and the campaign is restarted. This operation is recorded in the device log and the Activity Log. Items to consider: 1. This feature only works on devices with client version 1.1.16 or later. 2. A push notification may take a maximum of 2 weeks, according to Google's notification policy. 3. This new Force client refresh button replaces the Push campaign button. Back to release notes",

Web console and device app now show more device details The Knox E-FOTA web console > Devices screen has replaced the Device Status with more detailed information: Operation status: Describes the status of the device licensing and campaign sync. Campaign status: Describes the status of an assigned campaign. Client status: Describes the status of the Knox E-FOTA client app on the device. Update status: Describes the status of a firmware update, information that is now also included in the Device Update Status dashboard and Campaign Graph. Other related new features: For details about the new statuses, you can hover over the status to pop up a tooltip description in the Device Update Status dashboard. You can now see the total number of devices to be updated and the number that have completed their updates so far. The Knox E-FOTA app on the device now shows the Client status, which is synchronized with the web console. Previously, the web console and device showed different status information. Synchronize device groups from multiple EMM instances Previously, you could re-use device groups defined in a single EMM instance. Now, you can connect to up to five different EMM instances, which can be of the same EMM vendor (for example, multiple on-prem servers) or different EMM vendors. The Knox E-FOTA web console identifies the different EMM instances, which you can selectively synchronize groups with, desynchronize groups with, or remove entirely. Synchronize Organization type groups from Knox Manage As you might know, you can use device groups configured in your EMM to deploy Knox E-FOTA firmware updates by predefined groups. To learn more about this feature, see Managing EMM groups and Add device groups from Knox Manage. Previously, you could re-use only User, Device, and AD/LDAP based groups from Knox Manage. Now, you can also re-use Organization groups to enable Knox E-FOTA updates for all devices. Seamless integration with Managed Service Providers (MSPs) An MSP can use the Knox Managed Service Provider program to onboard multiple Knox customers, manage their Knox services, and deploy services onto their devices. Previously, MSPs could manage only the Knox Configure and Knox Mobile Enrollment services on behalf of customers. With this KCS 1.38 release, MSPs can now also manage Knox E-FOTA. Specifically, MSPs can: Onboard new Knox E-FOTA customers on the MSP portal. Migrate existing Knox E-FOTA customers to the MSP program. Upgrade existing MSP customers to include the Knox E-FOTA service. Manage Knox E-FOTA services on behalf of customers, including Knox E-FOTA Administrator functions. Check the customer status, which can be Pending (customer hasn't yet approved or rejected Knox E-FOTA management), Active (customer has consented), Rejected (customer has not consented). Give customers view access to the Knox E-FOTA console to monitor setup. Browse a log of MSP activities related to the Knox E-FOTA services. Delink Knox E-FOTA from a managed customer's Knox services. Subscribe to Knox E-FOTA emails. Both the MSP and managed customer can get emails about adding and migrating customers, changing customer access levels, and removing a customer service. SSO with Microsoft Azure Active Directory As you might know, the Knox cloud services support Single Sign On with MS Azure AD, in addition to sign on with a Samsung Account. Previously, only Knox Configure and Knox Mobile Enrollment supported AD SSO. With the KCS 1.38 release, Knox E-FOTA also supports AD SSO. For info about how to set up AD SSO, see Sign in with Azure AD. Back to release notes",

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 1.39 Enroll devices with Google services disabled Until the Knox service 1.38.1 release, you could not enroll devices with Google Services disabled into Knox E-FOTA. Starting with this release, for devices using EDM, EMM, or any other Knox services and for which Google services - that is, `com.google.android.gms` - are disabled, you can still enroll your device in Knox E-FOTA successfully. Changes for License assignment Previously, if a device that was uploaded by multiple sources, including resellers, was removed by the EMM, the device was automatically removed. Going forward, if a device is uploaded by a reseller with Auto Enroll or Auto Campaign enabled, and then even if EMM removes that device, the device is not removed. Additionally, the license and campaign are also assigned to the device automatically based on reseller preferences. Last synced time of EMM group Previously, last synced time was only updated either after periodic Auto Sync or whenever all the groups are synced. With this release, for VMware only, the Last synced on time updates instantly once the new group is synced to Knox E-FOTA using either Manage EMM groups, Sync now, or Periodic Auto Sync. Last synced time reflects the integration between Knox E-FOTA and EMM, and acknowledges that the changes that you made are synced successfully. We plan to apply this change to other EMMs with future releases. Consolidated onboarding Previously, IT admins could either apply for different services separately or collectively for Knox Suite. With this release, consolidated onboarding is supported for all services. That is, when you enroll for www.samsungknox.com, an enrollment application is automatically made for all Knox services.

            "content": "Knox E-FOTA 1.40 release notes. Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 1.40 Support for email preferences Previously, users received all emails from the Knox E-FOTA tenant. Now in Knox E-FOTA 1.40, users can configure email preferences from the console. For example, if you don't want to receive emails from Knox E-FOTA, you can disable the flags for all Knox E-FOTA-related emails in Manage services & preferences > EMAIL PREFERENCES. Improved license assignment functionality As Knox E-FOTA uses Knox Suite licenses, license seats are shared across all Knox Suite services. As a result, the remaining seat count on the License details page may not be accurate. That is, you may be able to enroll more devices than the number of remaining seats shown. Prior to the Knox E-FOTA 1.40 release, you could only assign licenses to devices based on the remaining seat count displayed in License details. Now, an Assign license option is added to the Upload Devices menu in bulk actions and the Device tab to reflect the improved licensing behavior. With the new license assignment feature, you can select licenses for your devices to consume seats from. If you're assigning devices to a Knox Suite license that are already enrolled in other Knox cloud solutions using the same license, those devices do not consume additional seats. For example, if you have a Knox Suite key with 5 license seats and 5 devices are already enrolled in Knox Manage using that key, the remaining seat count is shown as 0 in Knox E-FOTA. However, you can still enroll those 5 devices in Knox E-FOTA as assigned seats can be reused with other Knox Suite services. Force client refresh for EMM group devices In Knox E-FOTA 1.40, the Force client refresh action is added to the EMM groups tab. Sending this command wipes current campaign info from the selected devices, updates the Knox E-FOTA client app, and syncs the latest campaign info. This feature is only available for devices that have the Knox E-FOTA client app installed - otherwise, it's disabled. See Push and poll for more details. Support for overnight firmware installation Previously, you could only set the firmware installation end time to a value greater than the start time, meaning some overnight time periods were unavailable for selection. You can now configure firmware to install overnight, spanning two days. For example, you might choose to have the installation take place from 10 pm to 2 am. Note that the installation period must be at least 3 hours long. Updated installation logic for the Knox E-FOTA client with Knox Configure Before KCS 1.40, if the Block applications from unknown sources feature was enabled in Knox Configure (KC), the Knox E-FOTA client could not be installed on the KC-managed devices. With this release, the installation logic is updated so the Knox E-FOTA client can automatically bypass the Block applications from unknown sources feature. Blocked FOTA installation before Knox E-FOTA enrollment In previous Knox E-FOTA versions, after out-of-the-box enrollment, end users could install FOTA (firmware-over-the-air) updates through a popup that took precedent over the Knox E-FOTA agent enrollment. Doing so prevented partner apps from working due to an OS mismatch. Now, the Knox enrollment service first checks whether the device is added to Knox E-FOTA console. If so, then the device is blocked FOTA updates before the device is enrolled to Knox E-FOTA console. Option to disable EMM group auto-sync Knox E-FOTA 1.40 adds an option to toggle auto-sync on and off on the EMM groups page. With this new feature, super admins can choose whether to automatically sync Knox E-FOTA with EMM group info after a pre-defined time interval. For more information, refer to Manage EMM groups. Improvements to device deletion in EMM groups Starting from Knox E-FOTA 1.40, devices in the console remain available even if they are deleted from their corresponding EMM groups or the EMM group is desynced. Only the device's group information is deleted, but the campaign, license, and upload source information is still accessible. This new behavior is to prevent accidental device deletion caused by issues with EMM group sync. Devices that were uploaded through an EMM can be deleted in the Devices tab or through a CSV upload. For devices that were uploaded through an EMM but are not associated with an EMM group, you cannot modify their license or campaign info. You must either reassign the device to an EMM group through EMM group sync, or delete and re-enroll the device. Back to release notes",

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 21.11 Starting with this release, Knox product versioning will be named based on dates, specifically the year followed by the month. For example, this November 17, 2021 release - what would have been Knox cloud service 1.41 - uses 21.11 as the version name. End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Gradual campaign rollout This release allows you to randomly and gradually rollout campaigns to devices. You can rollout the campaign at a certain rate to a random set of devices daily. For example, 5% of the devices can start a firmware download on the first day, the next 5% on the day after, and so on. This feature helps with troubleshooting and discovering critical issues with firmware rollout and prevents the spread of bad firmware to all company devices, helping to maintain business continuity. The option to set a gradual campaign rollout is in campaign creation. Network throttling per Wi-Fi SSID With this release, you can now specify maximum download speeds for specific networks identified by SSID in your campaigns. This means you can throttle download speeds for up to five specific SSIDs and you can check which network is being used to download firmware to the devices assigned to the campaign. You can also see how many devices are using a specific SSID to download firmware on the dashboard. Detailed firmware information on device This release adds detailed firmware information in the firmware install ready pop-up notice. This gives more information such as improvements, firmware file size and security patch level about new firmware updates to the end user. Daily email reports for campaign updates With this release, you can subscribe to daily email updates reporting the number of updated devices and failures. These reports can help you better track devices that may need special attention with firmware updates. You can also see error details if the number of failed devices exceeds 20% of the total number of devices. Automatic re-assignment of license and campaign to EMM groups This release introduces automatic re-assignment of a license and campaign to devices in an EMM group which were not assigned. This feature prevents situations where devices in an EMM group are left unassigned because the default license did not have enough seats to hold all the devices in an EMM group. This process is done automatically after an EMM sync, and you can also trigger this process by re-assigning a license and campaign to EMM groups. USB Ethernet support With this release, devices can download firmware over a USB Ethernet connection. This feature allows you to download firmware on a large number of devices at high speeds without slowing down wireless networks. Ethernet connectivity is supported as long as the campaign allows Wi-Fi downloads. You can set this when creating or editing a campaign. Changes to client app deletion With this release, the Knox E-FOTA client app is no longer deleted from a device when it is unenrolled or deleted from Knox E-FOTA. You can uninstall the client app through your EMM, and an end user can still manually uninstall the client app after their device is unenrolled or deleted from Knox E-FOTA. This change removes the hassle of re-installing and launching the client app when re-registering the unenrolled devices. Changes to EMM group syncing This release limits the number of groups that can be added from an EMM instance to 1000. This change is to reduce server load and prevent loss of services. Improvements to campaign syncing In this release, the campaign information is synced only if the target firmware version of the device assigned to the campaign has changed. Syncing only when necessary reduces usage of resources and network loads. Back to release notes",

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 22.01 Support syncing duplicate devices in an EMM group This release allows you to sync devices in an EMM group to Knox E-FOTA even if there are duplicate devices in the EMM group. An enrolled device that is factory reset and then re-enrolled creates a duplicate of the device in the EMM group. Previously, an EMM group sync with Knox E-FOTA would fail if there were any duplicate devices. Now you can sync devices in an EMM group to Knox E-FOTA even if duplicate devices are present.

This release introduces the ability to create, edit, and delete custom roles with specific permissions. This feature allows you to assign admins to custom roles, giving you more flexibility when granting permissions and allowing you to better manage your admin roles. Device Log refresh With this release, you can now refresh the device log on the Device Log page. A new Refresh button allows you to refresh the device log without having to close the page and open it again to see any updates. License auto-assignment With this release, licenses are automatically assigned to devices after the Knox E-FOTA client is installed and enrolled on the device. Devices assigned to a license that expires in two days are automatically re-assigned another license. This means that you no longer have to manually assign a license to each device, or replace licenses that expire soon. You can still manually replace licenses and unenroll devices if needed.

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 22.05 Improvements to client app installation through OOBE Previously, the Knox E-FOTA client app would automatically install on devices through the out-of-box experience (OOBE). This behavior caused issues on devices not intended to be managed by E-FOTA, as the client app would install when not needed and potentially consume a license. With this release, devices requiring OOBE or auto-enrollment based on factory reset install the client app only if the following three conditions are met: The device is uploaded by a reseller. A campaign which isn't Cancelled is assigned to the device. A valid license is available. This improvement prevents unwanted installation of the client app and unwanted license consumption. For more information on how to prevent unwanted device enrollments and license consumption, see Unwanted Knox E-FOTA device enrollments and license consumption. Firmware trend graph With this release, you can view a firmware trend graph on your Knox E-FOTA dashboard. The graph displays how many devices are on which firmware grouped by security patch over the previous 8 weeks, updated every Monday (UTC\u00b100:00). You can also add two additional graphs with custom filters to show the information most important to you. This feature allows you to track the firmware update progress of your device fleet, and helps you identify any groups of devices that have persistent issues with firmware updates. Improvements to auto-install notification popup display time range With this release, you can set the auto-install timer duration up to 999 minutes. Manual firmware installation improvements With this release, device users can manually install firmware updates at any time of the day even if the current time is outside the firmware installation period. Start and end times in campaign information Previously, you could only view the start and end date for each campaign in the campaign table, the campaign information slide panel, and the campaign widgets on the dashboard. With this release, where campaign dates are shown, you can now view the precise time of day for a campaign's start and end dates, which gives you more detailed information on when exactly your campaign will start and end.

On the Create Campaign page, select Advanced as your download network, then set the priority for network types such as Wi-Fi, Mobile, and Ethernet. You can also disable one or more network types for use, but you must select at least one network type for firmware downloads. Selecting Mobile as the network type gives you the option to allow firmware downloads while roaming, and will switch the device's connection to Wi-Fi or Ethernet if the firmware package is larger than the size entered in the Enter size field. Notification center Starting with 22.11, notifications for events related to devices and EMM groups are listed in the notification center. The notification bell shows how many unread notifications you have. You can click the bell to open the notification center. Improvements to firmware installation reminders Starting with 22.11, installation reminder messages can be configured to be displayed for a duration of 1 to 999 minutes. This improvement, in addition to the existing, easily-configurable policies of installation postponement, is meant to help device users to install firmware updates sooner. You can also turn off the reminder message. Doing so will trigger firmware installation without notifying the device users, and also disables the Postpone installation settings on the page. Support for secondary IMEI on dual-SIM devices Previously, Knox E-FOTA wouldn't report the secondary IMEI (IMEI2) of dual-SIM devices. Device search, device lists, device detail pages, and exported reports now support queries for a device's secondary IMEI. If a dual-SIM device reports only one IMEI, the IMEI is denoted by either IMEI1 or IMEI2, depending on which SIM slot the card occupies on the device. Back to release notes",

To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Simplified registration for and access to Knox cloud services The registration and access flows for Knox cloud services are streamlined. The My Knox dashboard is retired, and you can now sign in to the Knox Admin Portal directly and manage your Knox services, including Knox E-FOTA. After you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you can operate Knox E-FOTA right away. If you'd like to display or register for additional Knox services, click your account icon > Settings > Show/hide services. Restrict firmware downloads based on Wi-Fi access points With the 23.03 release, you can now configure a campaign to have blocklists and allowlists of up to 50 Wi-Fi SSIDs each, to confine Wi-Fi firmware downloads to specific access points. Doing so prevents network clogging due to data-intensive updates. These restrictions don't affect downloads over mobile networks. Improvements to firmware scheduling Previously, campaigns lacked the option to set a firmware download period that was different from their installation period. With the 23.03 release, you can now configure these two periods separately. Furthermore, you can now easily schedule firmware updates to occur at any time during weekends and prevent network overuse during daytime hours. Campaign prioritization of EMM groups You can now easily reassign the campaign priority of multiple EMM groups by collectively moving them either to the top or bottom of the group priority list in one swift action. Whenever the device is associated with multiple EMM groups with multiple campaigns at the same time, the revised group priority decides which campaign and policies apply to a device. You can assign priority from both the Update group priority and Update all group priority dialogs on the EMM groups page. Improvements to EMM reconnection Previously, you could update your EMM connection credentials only when either your EMM password or client secret expired or changed. With the 23.03 release, you can now update your credentials at any time through the Reconnect EMM action on the EMM groups page. Available only to admins with EMM reconnection permissions. Fix for EMM group sync lock Previously, some users encountered a soft-lock issue when they tried to manually sync EMM groups prior to the completion of a group sync action. The 23.03 release prevents this issue by hiding the Sync now action until the ongoing EMM group sync is complete. Back to release notes",

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 23.06 OAuth authentication for VMware EMM Previously, you could sync devices from VMware EMM only using basic authentication. With the 23.06 release, you can also authenticate using the OAuth protocol. OAuth authentication requires a client ID and a client secret for successful EMM connection. Improvements to EMM group sync #Individually managed devices Previously, EMM groups controlled the behavior of synced devices and didn't allow you to individually manage these synced devices. This inability to manage devices individually forced you to unenroll the device from the group, even after the device was unsynced, making device management inconvenient for large fleets. With the 23.06 release, you can individually manage devices synced in EMM groups, without re-enrolling them. For example, if campaign A is assigned to devices in group A, you can now assign a few devices that are in group A to campaign B. Furthermore, for devices that are uploaded by EMMs, the Devices tab on the Devices page now lets you: Assign a campaign, create a campaign, Unassign a campaign, Unenroll devices, Force client refresh Additionally, you can click the EMM group name to access all the actions that you can perform on the Devices tab on the Devices page. #Default campaigns With the 23.06 release, when you assign a campaign to an EMM device group, this campaign is automatically set as the default campaign for the group. This default campaign is assigned only to devices in the group when they are synced from the EMM for the first time. These synced devices exhibit the following properties: The default campaign associated with these devices changes if their EMM group or EMM group priority changes. Note that these devices won't be automatically assigned to the new default campaign. After the first sync, existing devices synced from EMM groups won't be assigned the default campaign when you re-sync with the EMM. You can assign the default campaign to these devices, regardless of whether they were uploaded by a reseller or in bulk using a CSV file. You can find more information about the default campaign on the EMM groups page. Support for EMM group search With the 23.06 release, you can easily search EMM groups on the Manage EMM groups page and sync only the desired groups from the search results. Furthermore, you can individually sync each of these groups and filter the search results to display only the synced groups. You can search and add a maximum of 1,000 device groups without triggering a warning. UX enhancement to identify invalid firmware Starting with the 23.06 release, device firmware information displays a caution icon to help you determine whether a device listed on the Devices page is running invalid firmware. Support for dummy firmware in test campaigns Previously, the option to assign a test campaign to devices running dummy firmware wasn't available. This limitation persisted if you deleted or unenrolled such a device prior to reverting its firmware to regular firmware. With the 23.06 release, you can assign a test campaign even to devices running dummy firmware. Once you unassign a test campaign, the device reverts back to regular firmware. Back to release notes",

Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 23.09 Improvements to gradual campaign rollout Starting with the 23.09 release, you can gradually roll out a campaign to newly assigned devices without causing a reset to the rollout start date of devices that were already assigned the campaign. Doing so will reduce friction when you grow your device fleet, by preventing any delay in pushing firmware updates. Changes to the rollout rate, target firmware version, or campaign status will reset the rollout start date of all assigned devices. Prevent firmware update when pinned app is running Previously, an actively running pinned app blocked the device user from launching the E-FOTA client app. Furthermore, the pinned app triggered a Turn on Pin windows notification that blocked firmware installation reminders from the E-FOTA client app, creating an inconvenient experience. With the 23.09 release, by default, firmware updates no longer apply to the device when it's currently focused on a pinned app, which blocks notifications from the E-FOTA client app. You can allow firmware updates even when a pinned app is focused by adding the E-FOTA client app to the list of allowed apps for lock task mode - which is responsible for Kiosk mode and app pinning - through your EMM. Screen pinning is a native Android feature for device users that was added with Android 11. See Pin & unpin screens in Android Help for more background information.

When adding or removing devices with your EMM, you might encounter an issue with syncing the information to the E-FOTA console. Learn how to resolve the issue. When adding or removing devices with your EMM, you might encounter a discrepancy between the number of devices listed in your EMM and the Knox E-FOTA console. Cause Under certain conditions, the IMEI or serial number sync from your EMM to Knox E-FOTA fails, leading to an out-of-date device list on the Knox E-FOTA console. The Knox E-FOTA team is aware of the issue, and is working towards a fix. Workaround The workaround depends on whether your most recent action in your EMM was adding or removing devices. If you added devices: 1. Download the list of device IMEI or serial numbers as a CSV file from your EMM console. The procedure for this process depends on your EMM. 2. Upload the CSV file to Knox E-FOTA. If you removed devices: 1. Unenroll those devices from Knox E-FOTA. 2. Select and delete the devices from Knox E-FOTA.

Registering your devices in Knox E-FOTA You can add devices to Knox E-FOTA in three different ways: Uploading directly to the Knox E-FOTA portal, Registering through Knox Deployment Program (KDP), Registering through a UEM Out-of-box experience On devices running Android P and higher purchased through an official Samsung reseller, the Knox E-FOTA client app is automatically installed during the out-of-box experience. Devices are onboarded to Knox E-FOTA without user intervention. This feature is only available if your devices were registered through KDP. Auto Firmware Subscription When you create a campaign, default values are already set to streamline the creation process. Any values entered for the firmware installation period are validated through the Knox E-FOTA server. Multiple-model update per campaign You can now assign multiple device models with different firmware releases to a single campaign. Push and poll Ensure that campaign updates are quickly received by a device by either manually pushing the updates from the Knox E-FOTA server, or having the device poll the server for updates. The client app checks for and applies any changes that were not manually pushed. Additional information To learn more about Knox E-FOTA, see the Knox E-FOTA solution page.",

            "content": "Unwanted Knox E-FOTA device enrollments and license consumption. Some users experience issues with their Knox E-FOTA client app automatically installing on devices not intended for Knox E-FOTA through out-of-box-experience (OOBE). With the Knox E-FOTA 22.05 release, there's a feature enhancement to license auto-assignment and enrollment experiences. These improvements consist of: Pre-assigning devices using valid campaigns. When valid campaigns are implemented, only the devices enrolled through the Knox Reseller Portal with active campaigns participate in OOBE upon first-time kitting or factory reset. Additional license key verifications before allowing OOBE. This checks the existence of a valid license key (such as unexpired Knox E-FOTA or Knox Suite licenses). This article provides insights about the feature improvements and how to prevent unwanted device enrollments and license consumption in Knox E-FOTA. Cause During OOBE, the Knox E-FOTA client app installs on devices not intended to be managed by Knox E-FOTA. When you pre-load a device in Knox E-FOTA, either through the Knox Reseller Portal, a CSV file, or syncing through an EMM, Knox E-FOTA treats the device as a Knox E-FOTA participant and places it in Operation State: Approved. This means that the device is ready for license auto-assignment and enrollment once the client app installs and launches for the first time. This can cause the Knox E-FOTA client app to install on devices not intended to be managed by Knox E-FOTA when devices are pre-loaded through the Knox Reseller Portal with Auto approve enabled. Pre-loaded devices automatically enrolled in bulk example Below is an example scenario of a reseller bulk uploading pre-loaded devices through the Knox Reseller Portal: On the Manage reseller preferences page, Auto approve is enabled. As a result, all of the reseller-uploaded devices are eligible to use Knox E-FOTA. There are situations where some of the reseller-uploaded devices shouldn't be enrolled in Knox E-FOTA. If this is the case, refer to Manage devices to explicitly delete these devices from the Knox E-FOTA console. Otherwise, the devices are enrolled in Knox E-FOTA during the first time out-of-the-box or future factory reset configuration by the following sequence of events: 1. The device completes the initial power-up and set-up wizard configuration workflow. 2. If enabled by Knox Mobile Enrollment, the device automatically enrolls to an EMM. 3. The Knox E-FOTA client app automatically installs and enrolls after EMM enrollment. How to create a campaign for OOBE or factory-reset client installation Assign the target devices to a campaign before installing the Knox E-FOTA client app through OOBE or factory reset. Learn how to Create and assign a campaign. When you enable auto-enrollment, we recommend creating a simple campaign that doesn't have any device and firmware configurations. By doing so, there's no chance of accidental campaign updates taking place. How to assign a campaign There are two ways to assign a campaign: 1. Directly assign a campaign to your devices. 2. Automatically assign a campaign to all devices uploaded by a reseller. #Assign the campaign to the devices directly To assign a campaign: 1. On the Knox E-FOTA console, go to Devices and select the devices to assign the campaign to. 2. Click ACTIONS > Assign campaign. 3. Select the campaign you've created and click ASSIGN. #Automatically assign the campaign to all the devices by Reseller upon uploads If you need to enable auto-installation only on certain uploaded devices, don't use this option. All the devices that are uploaded by a reseller can install the Knox E-FOTA client app automatically by enabling Auto approve. Follow the steps below: 1. On the Knox E-FOTA console, click Resellers and select the Reseller name. 2. Click to enable Auto approve, then select the desired campaign 3. Click SAVE. 4. The desired campaign you've created is assigned to all devices uploaded by this reseller. Additional information To learn more about Knox E-FOTA, refer to the Knox E-FOTA guide.",

You may experience an issue where an active Knox Suite license doesn't activate all Knox Suite services despite its key showing on the consolidated Licenses page. For example, the Knox Admin Portal might show that you have an active Knox Suite license for Knox Manage when you click License or Knox E-FOTA > License. However, it could be the case that the license didn't actually activate Knox E-FOTA. Cause An active Knox Suite license is only registered for all Knox Suite services when it has been assigned to each of the individual services in the Knox Suite bundle. Resolution The permissions needed to assign licenses to products depends on the admin's role and permissions. Ensure that the below resolution is performed by a Super Admin or a secondary admin with the appropriate permissions. To assign an active Knox Suite license key to other services in the Knox Suite bundle, register its key to any services that haven't been assigned it: 1. On the Knox Admin Portal, go to Licenses. The consolidated Licenses page opens. 2. Click ACTIONS > Enter license key, then enter a License name and License key in the respective fields. Since you're assigning a license key that's already in use, make sure not to use a duplicate license name. By assigning the active Knox Suite license on the consolidated licenses page, you re-register the key to each respective Knox Suite services.",

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it. Purchase Knox commercial licenses from your local reseller. Server-based licenses Server-based licenses include both cloud and on-premises services. Enter cloud license keys on the Knox Admin Portal, and enter on-premises license keys directly on the service console.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

Depending on the service, you can manage your licenses from different locations throughout the Knox Admin Portal, individual services, and your EMM console. If your Knox Platform for Enterprise license is about to expire within the next 90 days, make sure to renew the license for another two years. Otherwise, your existing devices will be impacted.

For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

            "content": "Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps.

With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain.

The Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated, from partner feedback and industry data, to solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider. The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

Not only can IT admins have real-time access to what the remote device screen is displaying, but also control it by injecting actions such as finger, keyboard, and mouse events. Although other mobile platforms also offer remote viewing of remote device displays, only Knox provides built-in remote control of devices without requiring third-party solutions. Here is an example use case: An enterprise employee is on a business trip. On encountering a problem with the company-issued mobile phone, the employee contacts an enterprise IT\"admin. The IT\"admin uses an EMM console to remotely view the device screen to observe the issue first hand, then remotely controls the device, through finger, mouse, or keyboard actions. The IT\"admin directly accesses the environment to remotely debug the issue on the device.\"The employee is now quickly productive, without the frustrating downtime associated with relaying instructions verbally or through email. The continuous polling of the device screens doesn't impact device performance as devices send only screen changes. Unique advantages of Knox Remote Control The Knox Platform provides built-in remote control without requiring third-party solutions. For enterprises, this control: Saves time by enabling IT admins to troubleshoot remote mobile device issues in real-time. Reduces employee down-time and optimizes employee productivity through quick problem resolution.

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to.

The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account.

The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to.

Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service.

The centralized device info page displays the following: SERVICE - If the device is registered in a Knox cloud service and its user is invited to the service, the service name is shown. Click a service name to open the device's details on that service console and make updates to its info as required. Clicking a Knox Manage (KM) link opens that page on the KM console in a new browser tab. DEVICE STATUS - The last known enrollment status of the device, as reported by the service. Click a status to open a sliding panel containing additional device info. PROFILE - The profile assigned to the device, if applicable. Click a profile name to see details about the profile. For Knox E-FOTA, info about the assigned campaign is shown instead. DEVICE INFO - Service-specific info about the device. For example, if the service is KM, the device's associated user ID, organization, and/or group are shown. SERVICE END DATE - The date when the service or license expires. LAST SEEN - The date when the device last connected to the Knox cloud server. LAST MODIFIED - The date when changes were last pushed to the device. Delete a device from all Knox cloud services Admins with device management permissions for and access to all Knox cloud services can delete a device from all services with one action, instead of deleting it from each individual service. If a device uploaded from an EMM is deleted, and its EMM group is synced with Knox E-FOTA after deletion, the device will be added to Knox E-FOTA again. To delete a device from all services: 1. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, search for a device by its IMEI or serial number. 2. On the centralized device info page, click !Menu icon, then Delete device. You won't see this option if you don't have the right permissions. 3. If the device can be deleted from all the services it's enrolled in, you're prompted to confirm whether you want to continue with the device deletion. If so, click DELETE. If the device can't be deleted from one or more services, the reason for each service is shown in the popup. To proceed with the deletion, try again after you address each reason. If the deletion is successful, the device is deleted from all supported services in the Knox Admin Portal, including Knox Remote Support. If the deletion is only partially successful, you'll see a notification for each failed deletion with a downloadable CSV file containing more information.",

            "content": "Knox Admin Portal 21.09 release notes. Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Support for Samsung account login using Google SSO In this release, IT admins accessing the Knox Admin Portal through the direct console link can now sign in to their Samsung account using Google SSO. On the Samsung Account sign-in page, a Continue with Google button is available at the bottom of the screen. An IT admin can click this button to log in with their Google credentials and access the Knox Admin Portal. Okta SSO integration With 21.11, IT admins can set up Okta SSO to log in to SamsungKnox.com and the Knox Admin Portal. The three available SSO options are as follows: 1. Okta 2. Microsoft Azure AD 3. Ping Identity Please note that once Okta SSO is set up for a Knox cloud services tenant, its users can no longer log in to Knox services with their Samsung account credentials. See Configure Okta SSO settings for integration steps. Refreshed navigation sidebar The Knox Admin Portal navigation sidebar was refreshed for Knox cloud service 21.11. The color contrast between menu levels was increased, and a branding icon was added next to the name of each solution. Back to release notes",

In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, enter a device IMEI/MEID or serial number to display all services the device is enrolled in, as well as its service-specific info. For example, if you search for a device that's enrolled in Knox Manage, info about its associated user ID, organization, and/or group shows under DEVICE INFORMATION. Consolidated administrators and roles menu Previously, IT admins managed admins and their roles separately for each Knox cloud service. Now, the consolidated administrators page offers a single interface for select admins to manage secondary admins. Through it, admins from any Knox cloud service who have invite permissions can invite and manage secondary admins. This new screen supports all existing admin functionality, but provides an at-a-glance view of all services that each admin has been invited to.

In this release, the Knox Remote Support feature is available in the Knox Admin Portal to all enterprise customers with a valid trial or commercial Knox Suite license.

See Knox Remote Support Viewer to learn more.

This consolidated page is accessible from License in each service console and from the Licenses entry above Administrators & Roles in the Knox Admin Portal navigation pane. You can add, manage and delete your Knox cloud service license keys on this page.

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

When a dumpstate log is captured from the affected device, the following error is shown: > androidboot.warranty_bit=1 Cause The Samsung Knox warranty bit has been tripped. Available on all Samsung Knox-compatible devices, the Knox warranty bit is a security feature that detects if unofficial software has been installed on your phone. This prevents malicious attempts to access your data. The Knox Warranty Bit, a one-time programmable bit e-fuse, detects if a non-Knox kernel is loaded on the device. The warranty bit has a value of \"0\" but changes to \"1\" if an older or unofficial Android build is installed on the device, indicating that the security of the Knox container has been compromised. If the Knox Warranty Bit has been tripped, the device is prevented from using Knox services. Resolution A tripped Knox Warranty Bit cannot be reverted, and Knox services will not work on the device. To restore functionality for KCS solutions, a hardware replacement of the device's Printed Board Assembly (PBA) is required. Troubleshooting If you see an error in the format below during the enrollment process, it typically indicates that the warranty bit has been blown. > [ENROLLMENT ERROR] because a custom OS is or has been installed on this device.

Using KDA, some administrators have reported that they are not able to enroll devices in more than one KCS. When adding a device in a second service (e.g. enrolling in Knox Mobile Enrollment after enrolling in Knox Configure), the following error message is shown: > The device is already enrolled. Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process. The NFC enrollment method will be deprecated from Android 11 onwards. Resolution Currently, KDA is only designed for use with one KCS service at a time.\"To avoid encountering issues with Bluetooth and NFC enrollment, please ensure you remove your device from any KCS services it is in before enrolling in another.

Although the support for the oldest version is no longer available on every first major release in the year, Knox solutions are supported on the latest five major Android versions. With this change, we commit to: 1. Maintain the best-in-class product quality by focusing our resources on the versions that majority of you use. 2. Enhance the security of Knox products by restricting the supported versions to recent ones that have valid security patches from OS or hardware. Exceptions , Knox Platform for Enterprise is supported from Knox 2.4 and each feature is dependent on the specific Knox version. Knox Manage is supported from seven major Android versions (6-12) as of March 2022. To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted.
