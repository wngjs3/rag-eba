Knox Guard offers a free trial license and a paid commercial license: Trial license - You can generate a trial license in the Knox Admin Portal from the Licenses page. The trial license has a three-month License activation period and a three-year License device usage period. The trial license only has 30 seats, meaning you can only activate 30 devices with it. Commercial license - You can purchase a commercial license from the sales team in your country. The commercial license has a one-year License activation period and a three-year License device usage period. Once purchased, you can enter the license key in the Knox Guard console to activate it. As mentioned above, each license has two important periods - license activation period and License device usage period: License activation period - A commercial Knox Guard license has a one-year activation period. Devices can be activated with the license during this period. After the activation period, the license expires, meaning no additional devices can be activated using that license anymore. However, the devices themselves remain active for a period of three years. This three-year period is called the License device usage period. If you buy additional seats for the license, the activation period is extended for one year from the date of the purchase. License device usage period - After a device is activated using a Knox Guard license, it remains active under the license for three years from the date of its activation, even if the license itself is past the License activation period or expired. This period is staggered, meaning each device enjoys a full three-year usage from its activation date regardless of the license expiry date. Once a license is activated on a device, the license is irrevocable and cannot be transferred to a different device. Manage Knox Guard licenses: 1.

When a device is successfully enrolled in Knox Guard, it enters an Active state. _PURCHASED SEATS_ - Displays the maximum number of devices each listed license has paid to support. A Trial license supports 30 seats by default. Commercial licenses are negotiated point-of-sale for the number of license seats included. _REMAINING SEATS_ - Lists the total license count still available, minus assigned licenses. When a device successfully enrolls and moves to an active state, the count decreases by 1. _ASSIGNED SEATS_ - Lists the number of devices assigned a license seat. The number listed also includes consumed license seats. When a device is accepted, the Assigned column count increases by 1. _ACTIVATED SEATS_ - Lists the number of devices that have been activated for each listed license. Activated seats are also included within the Assigned seats total. _ACTIVATION END DATE_ - Displays the expiration date after which licenses can no longer be assigned or activated on devices.

            "content": "Samsung Knox Deployment App. The Knox Deployment App is a mobile application available from the Google Play Store that is uniquely designed to help streamline the enterprise deployment of Samsung phones and tablets running Knox 2.8 or higher. The Knox Deployment App enables customers to seamlessly enroll devices using Knox mobility solutions. About The Knox Deployment App provides the flexible option to IT admins needing to bulk enroll end-user devices without having a reseller. Using this app allows IT Admins to reduce their bulk deployment time, by using a master device without factory resetting each device. Once enrolled, an IT admin can easily locate the devices within Knox Guard. #Bluetooth enrollment To support Bluetooth-based enrollment, an IT admin can install the KDA on a dedicated admin/master smartphone or tablet device. If the user's device is within proximity of the master device, the user device connects to the admin device via Bluetooth without a PIN or password requirement. #NFC enrollment With _Near Field Communication_ (NFC) enrollments, a non-B2B device is \"bumped\" (held closely together) with another smartphone device with Knox Deployment App running and scanning in NFC mode. The dedicated master NFC device displays profiles available for enrollment and end user device enrollment begins once an IT admin selects a profile. The NFC enrollment option is not available to tablet devices. Using the Knox Deployment App does not apply the profile to the admin/master device. It only broadcasts the profile to the devices in the vicinity. Only end-user devices within physical proximity of the admin/master device with an active Knox Deployment App can Bluetooth or NFC enroll to Knox Guard. The screens utilized within this guide are from a smartphone. If running the Knox Deployment App on a tablet, the information on the screen would be identical, just optimized to fit the tablet's display capabilities. #App version information Knox Deployment App version information and available open source licenses can be referenced from within the ABOUT screen. Samsung recommends you periodically compare the Knox Deployment App's version to the latest available from Samsung to ensure you have the latest feature set and functionality available. To launch the Knox Deployment App's ABOUT screen: 1. Invoke the drop-down menu from the top, right-hand, side of the device and select About. 2. Refer to the listed version number and note the version. If needed, select Open source licenses to review the available open source licenses available to your Knox deployment. Prerequisites To support Bluetooth or NFC enrollments using the Knox Deployment App, the IT admin must: 1. Secure a Knox Portal account and ensure: Your devices support the Bluetooth or NFC protocols. Check your device specification if unsure. You have at least one profile configured in Knox Guard 2. Secure the appropriate licenses to enroll devices (through the Samsung Knox Portal). 3. A Knox Portal account. 4. Install the Knox Deployment on an admin/master device, and login using their Knox Portal ID/password. 5. Select a profile on the master device to apply to the end-user devices. Using the Knox Deployment App This section describes the screen flow navigation for a typical Bluetooth or NFC based enrollment using the Knox Deployment App. 1. Select SIGN IN once the Knox Deployment App launches on the device. If the Knox Deployment App is already running on the device, the initial screen does not display, and the application displays the sign in screen. 2. Enter the Knox Portal Username and Password to sign in to the Knox Deployment App. 3. Select Remember me to display and utilize the username in subsequent Knox Deployment App logins. If you encounter difficulty logging in to the Knox Deployment App, ensure you have either a valid Knox Portal account with privileges for Knox Guard. If that is not the issue, select Forgot your email or password? for assistance retrieving your login credentials. 4. Select SIGN IN to proceed with the device login. Once you have successfully signed in to the Knox Deployment App, a WELCOME screen displays providing first-time options for profile selection and deployment mode. Once the Knox Deployment App profile selection and configuration mode are set, the selected options display within their respective fields, the START DEPLOYMENT option enables, and the Welcome portion of screen no longer displays in subsequent logins. Profile selection Select a profile to utilize within the Knox Deployment App to apply specific device settings to the master admin device using Bluetooth or NFC to enroll end user devices. To select a configuration profile using the Knox Deployment App: 1. Select Tap here to select a profile from the Welcome screen display a list of profile selection options. 2. Optionally filter whether All profiles are listed for potential selection. The most recent profile additions display first within their respective categories. Each listed profile has a brief description to help determine its relevance to a potential Bluetooth device enrollment using the Knox Development App. An important distinction to the profile description is the profile's relevance to either phones and tablets or wearable devices. If needed, select the Search icon near the top of the screen to display a search field where existing profiles can be located and displayed. The search function only locates filtered profiles. If no profiles are available, a profile requires registration at SamsungKnox.com. 3. Select a listed profile. Once selected, the profile displays upon subsequent logins. The profile is now ready for Bluetooth or NFC deployment mode selection as described in the sections that follow. Bluetooth Deployment Once profiles are set on the master admin device, the IT admin needs to set Bluetooth as the deployment mode and define the Bluetooth duration interval. End users can then enroll their device by entering the appropriate URL. To deploy devices using the KDA: 1. From the admin master device, navigate to the SELECT DEPLOYMENT MODE screen and select Bluetooth as the device deployment mode. 2. Set the Bluetooth Duration for either 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours or 8 hours. Select OK to save the update. The Bluetooth duration is deployment activation period for end user devices receiving their profile configuration from the IT admin's master device. Once the set duration expires, devices cannot enroll with the Knox Deployment App, and the process must be repeated to continue the enrollment of other required devices. 3. From the Knox Deployment screen, the admin selects START DEPLOYMENT to initiate the defined Bluetooth Duration interval. As long as the defined Bluetooth Duration interval is still counting down, and user has not put the application in the background, the device's display will not time out. Bluetooth must be turned on and running on the device to start deployment. If Bluetooth is off, a prompt displays and the admin must select TURN ON to enable Bluetooth. 4. The device's end user must go to https://me.samsungknox.com and complete the instructions provided. 5. The end user then selects FINISH DEPLOYMENT to complete the enrollment. Once completed, the Bluetooth enrolled device displays within Knox Guard. If necessary, refer to the device's About screen for Knox Deployment App version information and open source license availability. NFC Deployment Once profiles are set on the master admin device, the IT admin sets NFC as the deployment mode. To deploy devices using the KDA: 1. From the admin master device, navigate to the SELECT DEPLOYMENT MODE screen and select NFC as the device deployment mode. To deploy, both NFC and Android Beam must be on within the device's Settings menu. 2. Beam enrollment information to the receiving device by holding the admin/master device back-to-back with an NFC enabled and compatible device and then pressing the screen as illustrated below. 3. Select FINISH DEPLOYMENT on master/admin device once the NFC beam is completed with the end user device. Once completed, the NFC enrolled device displays within Knox Guard. If necessary, refer to the device's About screen for Knox Deployment App version information and open source license availability.",

A developer generates an API key from Knox Guard Console and embeds the key in calls to the API. Data from the API is secured by whitelisting a specified IP address. If the API's active key is lost or compromised, a new key can be regenerated and the old key deleted. Knox Guard APIs support device uploads, device acceptance, subscription payment overdue messaging and blink reminders, device lock/unlock, and licensing. To use the API, a dedicated account requires creation by the Samsung Knox Guard team on behalf of the integrating customer. For more information, contact your Samsung Knox Guard representative. Auto-refresh enhancements To date, the data displayed within the console was not refreshing in real-time and consistently amongst all screens as data was updating, resulting in customer confusion as to what data is current and what requires a refresh. With this enhancement, console data is consistently auto-refreshed as data is changed or updated. Contact resource flexibility added With this release, a device user's blink reminder and device lock contact resource can be provided as a phone number or E-mail address. Either a phone number or E-mail address is required, but now it is optional which subscriber contact type is used. Completing status cancellation period added If a device is marked as Payment Complete, its status changes to Completing\u2026 and remains this way for 2 days. The user has 2 days to cancel it while in the Completing\u2026 state, which reverts the device back to an Active state. If no action is taken after 2 days, the status changes to Payment complete and the Knox Guard application is uninstalled permanently. The device however is not automatically deleted from the server, and must be removed manually. Device deletion improved A Knox Guard admin can delete a device from the Knox Guard console when the device is in a payment complete or rejected state. When a device is deleted from Knox Guard, the device is removed from the server and the Knox Guard client is uninstalled. When deleted, all of the device's information and history are removed.

Knox customers will find the updated version of Knox Guard easier to navigate, as user interface elements have been logically combined to reduce the number of steps required to complete key management tasks. The central update is the introduction of a collapsible left-hand navigation menu, replacing the previous horizontal menu bar. This provides a visual hierarchy of key Knox Guard payment management activities and administrator \"call-to-actions.\" The new Knox Guard console is personalized, with improved status updates from each user's previous login. Colorized status indicators optimally display \"at-a-glance\" event severity to administrate with best in class efficiency.

An emergency message is now available on a locked device To date, a Knox Guard managed device cannot receive and display emergency messages when in a locked device state. This restriction can create serious legal issues in countries and regions where the broadcast of emergency messages is required. To remedy this situation, emergency messages are now displayed above a device's lock screen while the device remains in its current locked state. No additional device-side screens are introduced with the addition of the emergency. Offline device lock capability added To date, Knox Guard does not provide the ability to lock an offline device. Consequently, if a user does not purposely connect to network, the device is rendered out of Knox Guard control by not receiving its policy from its dedicated Knox Guard server. Beginning with this release, a device can be locked when out of network after a configurable period of time. Before the timer is expired and the device is locked, an admin can display an offline lock warning message at a defined frequency. Once an offline device is locked, the device user is required to contact their carrier to restore functionality. The device user must share the challenge code on their device's lock screen (generated when the device was locked), and then the admin provides a PIN to the device user to enter on their device to restore its functionality. The offline lock feature is only supported on devices running Android P or above. Device unlock functionality update Beginning with this release, a device user and an IT admin must collaborate to unlock a device. An IT admin needs to generate a PIN from the passkey displayed on the user's device, then share the PIN with the device user to unlock their device. In this case, both the PIN generation algorithm and password generation method are updated. This device unlock update is only supported on devices running Android P or above. Separate default enrollment and SIM change messaging now available With this release, enrollment notices can be optionally enabled for end-user devices. Once globally enabled, separate completion of enrollment and SIM change messages can be optionally enabled as well. The completion of enrollment message is a customizable, 200-character maximum, message displayed once the setup wizard is completed on the device. The SIM card change message is a non-customizable message displayed when the SIM card is changed on the mobile device. Back to release notes",

KG + KC/KME on the same device This feature enables KG and KC/KME services to be used together on the same device so customers can protect their devices with KG, use KC for automatic device configuration or re-branding updates, and also use KME for device enrollment, management and app installations. Typically, customers want to use KG with KC/KME to provide better device branding and management for deployments within their specific marker segments. In turn, this will drive up their sales, generate additional revenue for KCS, and expand the overall customer base for Knox services. To accommodate the combined use of these services, a reseller can now upload a device to KG as well as KC/KME using one customer ID and account. Role-based access control (RBAC) This release introduces a new _Role-based access control_ (RBAC) capability that allows customer (tenant) admins who are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though each supported Knox Cloud Service utilizes admin roles unique to that service, a Super Admin cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available. For information on creating a new admin account and assigning them unique roles and permissions, go to: Manage administrators. Upload devices directly to the KG server Currently, to use devices in KG they must be purchased through a reseller. The customer must request registration (upload device IMEIs) in their reseller portal or using reseller API. Additionally, the customer can only use devices registered through their reseller within the KG console once approved and accepted with a valid KG license. However, the process described above does not enable non-carriers, such as financial institutions, to use KG since they are not in a physical device channel, or function as resellers. For such customers, the KG team has provided tenant permission control within the Samsung Admin portal and provided user permission control within the KG console to grant permissions to limited users. Additionally, an IMEI verification step has been added to ensure a wrong device IMEI is not auto-accepted and registered. Device deletion improvement for KG + KC/KME This feature introduces a new device deletion concept when KC/KME is deployed with Knox Guard. Once devices are uploaded to a customer ID with KG/KC/KME accesses, devices are added to all three consoles by default. If the customer would like to use only KG on their devices, they can remove those devices from just the KC and KME consoles only. Back to release notes",

License count and utilization enhancements This enhancement enables the console to only display 100% of the total ad remaining license seats available, as opposed to 110% of the seats available, which contributed to confusion over the actual number available for both total and remaining license seats. Additionally, the number of assigned licenses now displays in red when the count exceeds 100% of the assigned allocation to more efficiently display and differentiate and exceeded allocation. The red exceeded license display is also accompanied by a pop-up message stating the license seat limit has been exceeded, and to contact your reseller to purchase more license seats to regain compliance. License usability console improvements Currently, the status and expiration date displayed in the console's License menu do not adequately reflect the service period. Consequently, the license activation display requires an update to be meaningful in respect to the actual license activation and license seat consumption. To remedy this issue, and reduce uncertainty with Knox Guard's service license concept, the console's License screen will be updated display additional information about the license's activation, service period, and expiration date. Additionally, a new tool-tip is included to inform administrators the license expiration date is predicated on the actual license activation date. The Device screen is also updated to show the expiration date for each device utilizing the license, and the Device Details screen reflects a particular device's license activation date. Improved license consumption messaging When a Knox Guard admin enters a commercial license key, they need to informed of the new KCS license exhaustion policy. To address this issue, the KCS team has added an explanation to prevent mistakes using a commercial/trial license. The new message will state that if you enter a commercial key and use it for commercial purposes, you should delete the trial key used as a test first. If the Trial key remains or is newly added, that the trial key is exhausted first. Dashboard visualization improvements With this release, license status and consumption trending can be customized from the console's Dashboard for more efficient license availability assessment. SIM control notification customizations This feature addresses customer requests to send a customizable device notification message when an approved SIM is removed from a Knox Guard managed device. The message is intended to notify the device user their SIM cannot be detected, or is from an unsupported service provider and requires a different SIM. To address this request, the console UX has been updated to allow an admin to provide a customized message from the SIM control lock screen. Back to release notes",

SIM card swap enhancements To date, customers are unsure whether Knox Guard is working as intended in respect to SIM card swaps and SIM swap data reporting. In particular, how many device users have attempted to swap their SIM card. With this release, SIM card change attempts can be logged and sent to the Knox Guard Server to provide greater visibility into potential device rooting events. To implement this enhancement, the Knox Guard Devices page has filter options added within the IMEI/SN column to select SIM Control enabled and/or SIM change attempts detected Additionally, a SIM card policy icon is added indicating when a SIM card change attempt is detected. A pop-up will display when hovering over the icon describing the SIM card change attempt in greater detail. Limitation added to administrator invitation role assignments To avoid the further escalation of Knox Guard administrative roles and permissions issues, an existing admin who does not have a manage roles permission requires additional restrictions regarding the roles they can assign to other administrators. With this release, existing administrators without a manage role permission can only invite admins with a matching set of their own role permissions. As a result, the Invite administrator screen's Role drop-down menu choices have been customized for the particular role of the admin creating the invitation. URL link available within overdue message and blink reminder preview image With this release, a properly formatted URL (http://www...) can be now included in the device preview image text defined for either an overdue payment notification or blink reminder. When the device user taps the URL hyperlink, it opens the relevant Web page within the device browser. The addition of the URL is optional, but could be of great assistance to subscribers who want to make device user payment queries as seamless as possible for their customers. Dashboard statistics and visualization enhancements With this release the Knox Guard Dashboard has been updated to provide action success/fail rates and a License overview. Device SIM card changes are also displayed to provide greater visibility into potential; device rooting attempts. Hover over actions are also supported for more granular trending information. Each of these Dashboard enhancements has its own trending period drop-down menu as well as the ability to save graph content to a CSV or excel file for archive. Customizable SIM messages Currently, a SIM change message is only supported in English, and the system defined message cannot be translated into other languages. Consequently, non-English customers cannot adequately protect against cheating and the resell of a device to a 2nd buyer when an installment balance is remaining. To remedy this issue, a customizable SIM change notification is now displayed with every SIM change to help deter an unauthorized secondary device sale. Back to release notes",

In process state cancellation improvements To date, when a device is in a transitional state, an admin is required to cancel the current in-process operation (Locking, Unlocking, Completing, Starting Reminder, or Stopping Reminder) from the Device details screen before they can transition the device into a different desired state. With this enhancement, an admin can now move a device from the transitional state to an intended state without first canceling the in-process transitional state. As a result, the CANCEL button has been removed the bottom each Device details screen. Additionally, an admin can perform state transitions in batch mode for multiple devices by either selecting multiple devices or using a file. Carrier information added to Device screen display To date, admins have not been able to discern a listed device's carrier from the menu and filter options available within the Knox Guard Devices page.

However, too many \"device_state_invalid\" errors have been encountered, and each time such an error occurs it's difficult to determine a device's accurate status to properly troubleshoot the problem. To resolve this issue, rather than calling \"get device info\" to obtain the state, the Knox Guard server will return the device state whenever a \"device_state_invalid\" error is triggered. Disable blink reminders for scheduled intervals Customers have reported blink notifications can bother their device users, especially at night and on weekends, and have requested the ability to disable them for specific configurable periods. With this release, customers can now disable blink reminders for a configurable period of time without stopping or starting the blink reminder again. During the time blink reminders are disabled, they will remain as notifications. Phone number or email address required for contact information With this release, either a phone number or email address is required when setting a blink reminder, lock (automatic lock), offline lock (warning), or SIM control lock. With this requirement satisfied, a contact resource is now available if the device is rendered inoperable due to a device or SIM control lock. Last Seen parameter added for requesting customers A LAST SEEN column is now also available as a display option within the Knox Guard Devices screen. This column displays the last time a listed device IMEI/SN connected to the KG server. Both the Last Seen and Carrier fields are gated behind a feature flag so they can only be enabled for requesting customers. For more information on enabling this feature, contact your Knox Guard Samsung admin. Re-defined device log policies This update does not represent a change to existing Knox Guard statuses, and maintains the use of ~ing for various event states. However, sent has been added to the event description to better distinguish what we sent clearly. For example, Unlock device has been updated to Unlock device sent. Additionally, there has been so many device errors showing in device log that it becomes confusing for the customer to discern legitimate errors from non-essential internal errors. To remedy this confusion, the Knox Guard team has reduced the number of unnecessary internal errors and now only maintains valid errors interpreted as important to users. License usage dashboard improvements To date, when a license is added into Knox Guard and is activated the same month, the license utilization count within the Knox Guard Dashboard does not properly increment and accurately reflect the update. To remedy this situation, the Dashboard has been updated to accurately reflect license activations within the same month they were added into the Knox Guard console. Back to release notes",

CSV file enhancements To date, duplicate IMEIs display within a Knox Guard generated CSV file. These duplicate IMEIs can bloat the size of the file and skew the data in the file unnecessarily. To remedy this situation, a shell script command is now run against the CSV file. The command keeps the initial response of the device IMEI within the file and removed subsequent duplicates.

Activity log updates for administrative roles With this release, the activity log has been enhanced to provide a broader range of Knox Guard administrative event changes. These administration events include, administrator invitations, administrator modifications, resent/reactivated/revoked invitations, and deactivated/reactivated accounts. Performance enhancements for console searches Currently, it takes too long to search device IMEIs, serial numbers and approval IDs within Knox Guard Devices screen, since only a single query can be made at one time for a device search parameter. To address this shortcoming, the Knox Guard console now permits more granular searches based on the IMEI&SN, or ApprovalID selected as the search parameter. This update will increase search response time and improve performance. View only permissions added This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator view only permissions. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. When a View only radio button is selected, all nested options under that category (Devices and Uploads, Policies, Licenses, etc.) are disabled. Additionally, if a radio button has nested options and that category does not have View only selected, at least one of its permission checkboxes must also be selected. New roles have View only enabled by default. Added IMEI number to lock screen email To date, when a customer has locked the device of a delinquent user, the user sends an email from their Locked screen to their Customer Support. However, the IMEI has already been used to upload/enroll the device, and the customer cannot identify the Serial Number and are unable to locate the device within the Knox Guard console. To remedy this issue, an additional IMEI field has been added to the email sent to Customer Support. Going forward, when a customer receives an email from a locked device user they should be able to view the IMEI of the device for easier reference and identification. Back to release notes",

New lock screen settings A lock command is typically delivered to a device when Wi-Fi is enabled and available at home, work etc. However, a device may be unable to receive an unlock command if the device user not at home or work and unable to secure the required network connection. Even when a locked device user was to secure data connectivity at their carrier's store, their device lock screen still does not provide the means to change network connectivity setting to receive the unlock command. To address this shortcoming, mobile data and Wi-Fi on/off settings are required on the Lock screen when the device is in a locked state. Updated license depletion notification email Currently, the email informing and admin of a low license count is not received in time to re-order before depletion. To better support our customer deployments and better ensure license seats can be re-applied before depletion, we have changed the time and frequency license depletion emails are sent. With this release, admin emails are now sent when the license count is down to 10% (out of total) remaining seats, then another email when at 5%, and a final email at 3%. Location tracking enhancements The Knox Guard team recently decided to remove the located device map from the console, since the utilization of the map requires a contract requiring individual user consent. Going forward, the Knox Guard console will just display latitude and longitude data and provide a means for an admin to integrate this data to the map service of their choosing. Once the device's location is detected, its coordinates display as well as the time remaining before the next location refresh is available. The location can be refreshed up to 10 times a day. Once viewed, the location display cannot be refreshed for 10 minutes. The Locate device menu item only displays if the tenant has been granted permission, otherwise the menu item is hidden. Only a single device can be selected at a time. Approval ID search with special characters Customers often upload devices and approval IDs into Knox Guard, but are unable to search for a particular device using an approval ID, since an approval ID is not a filterable column option. Additionally, there is a limitation on the special characters that can be used in a search, even though approval IDs frequently use special characters like (/). To remedy this shortcoming, an approval ID is now included as a device search option within the Devices tab. Additionally, these special characters will be supported as search parameters (@, :, $, /, \\*, %, ^, &, \\\\ (, ), +, ?, , [],). First time device upload enhancements Customers have reported frustration locating the portion of the Knox Guard console used for first time device uploads into Knox Guard. To reduce console navigation uncertainty, an UPLOAD DEVICES button has been added to the Devices page. Once selected, the Upload devices screen displays. A tool tip is also included describing the subsequent device upload actions available to an admin by invoking this action. Device user overdue messaging enhancements Currently, payment overdue notifications can be easily ignored from the device's notification center, somewhat defeating the purpose of the overdue notification. To make overdue notifications difficult to ignore, an Initially show notifications as a full-screen message on user's device checkbox option has been added to the Default overdue notifications screen. When selected, the device user sees the fullscreen message before the message displays on the notification panel. If unsure how the notification will display on the target user's device, select Preview fullscreen message. Device event log collection Upon request, a device log has been implemented to capture events that are either sent automatically when a specific condition is met or dynamically when a push commend is received from the Knox Guard server. The device log is for internal debugging purposes and does not require a device user interface with log generation. The receipt of diagnostic information is optional. Admins now capable of invitation to multiple services To date, an admin is unable to invite another admin belonging to a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or an admin with Admin invitation permissions can now invite an admin belonging to a different service to a role in their service. For example, Admin 1 belongs to just KG with a non-Super Admin role. Admin 2 belongs to KME with a non-Super Admin role, but has Admin invitation permissions. Therefore, Admin 2 can invite Admin 1 to join KME for any role for which Admin 2 currently has permission. Back to release notes",

For more information on where to locate this setting, go to About the dashboard. Increased length of overdue and default lock screen messages Customers expressed the need to submit specific messages in several languages, and the 250 character maximum message length has proven inadequate in such instances. To address this request, the following notification and message length increases are implemented: Default overdue notification message length - Increase to 500 characters, Default lock screen message length - Increase to 350 characters Console search capability improvements Recently the KG team has been fielding reports from customers stating it takes too long to search for devices using a partial search for approval ID from the KG console. As more devices are added into KG the search latency increases proportionally. Going forward, only a full search will be supported of a device's IMEI or approval ID. The expectation is device searches should now only take approximately one second. Copyright notice added to all KG generated emails Going forward, each emails sent from either KG or the KG Samsung Admin console will have a copyright notice appended to the footer of the email. This requirement is based on a recent review requiring a copyright be appended to KG emails for legal compliance. Role deletion now permitted for all admin states other than active This feature addresses IT admin requests to delete a Knox Guard admin role with a pending, revoked or blocked state (any state but active). Prior to the role deletion, a message displays the intended admins impacted by the role deletion. Existing administrators assigned to the target role must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. For more information on where to locate this setting, see Delete a role.

Additionally, trail to commercial license conversion is now reflected in the KG console, along with the new 3 to 12-month activation period for the commercial license. Device status enhancements With this release, the Knox Guard device state flow has been changed to reduce limitations with any particular Knox Guard status state and enable admins to navigate seamlessly as events progress within the Knox Guard lifecycle. In particular, the Overdue status state and its related information have been removed. This will help reduce customer confusion and communication overhead by eliminating a largely unused device state. Additionally, when a blink reminder is initiated for a payment delinquent device, an admin can now move directly to locking the device without releasing the blink reminder state.

With this release, an option has been added to the App installation screen enabling an app to optionally launch automatically after installation so device users can use the app immediately. The app auto launches only at initial enrollment and factory reset. Localized device information Some Knox Guard supported countries use multiple languages. As a result, some customers want to send both customized and lock messages in the same language as the device language setting. With this release, a customer can obtain language info using the Knox Guard REST API (Get Device Info). Using the API, a customer can know the language utilization of the device. Once determined, the customer can send a message in multiple languages corresponding to the end-user device language.

            "content": "Knox Guard 20.11 release notes. SIM lock for PAYG This update introduces a SIM 'Lock' function for the PAYG model. This feature allows customers to prevent devices being resold to other countries by locking the device if a blocklisted SIM is inserted. Additionally, a submenu called 'Network registration verification' checks if the inserted SIM (even for allowlisted SIM) is an active one Overdue message over lock screen Devices get locked for various reasons and end-users try to unlock it through various methods. However, if a user does not know how to unlock, then they call the customer care center for assistance. This may increase call volume from the customer's perspective and take more time to resolve the issue. This feature can help customers by guiding them on how to unlock their devices or how to make a payment if needed. Through these messages, customers can save time and resolve their issues without having to call customer support. New lockscreen concept for R OS From R OS, the following changes have been made to optimize the screen for the customer's benefit: Customer app is placed at the main lockscreen (the App icon is extracted from the apk and its title text can be customized by the customer), More space is available for the lock message by changing the buttons into icons. R OS lockscreen will have the following GUI characteristics: Normal user lockscreen look and feel as much as possible, Vivid background, Call/Email button to the options screen to simplify main lock screen, Wi-Fi and mobile data icon button, Flexible Lock message area (with min & max height) Remove applied policies once completing Currently, some policies are applied to devices at the 'completing' status, which leads to issues if the device is locked due to the policy. 'Completing' is the prior step to complete which means the customer has made full payment and is waiting for the device to be released from KG control. The policies have been removed once the device has made its payment. The removed policies include: 1. SIM policy 2. Notices such as Enrollment and SIM card change 3. Relock timestamp 4. Offline lock PIN is not supported for Blink Reminder Currently, users can clear the 'Blink reminder' with a PIN code, but it is not necessarily required given that this reminder can be dismissed with an 'OK button'. The PIN input for the Blink reminder is not supported from KG 1.36 and onward New option for enrollment message Customers may worry about their device being resold to someone else, so a message that indicates the device is currently under a finance program is implemented. KG Console: there is a new option for displaying an enrollment notification (e.g. 'Always display the notification once KG enrolled') , Client: if the customer selects to display the enrollment notice to always show on the notification panel, it should be registered on the notification panel once the device is enrolled. This notification cannot be cleared until the device itself is deleted Back to release notes",

This allows our customers, such as operators or finance companies, prevent fraudulent reselling. Please note that additional permissions are required to enable this feature Increase application size for Application Installation Policy Currently, apps on the KG console have a size limit of 100MB based off the average size of an app. To support the request to increase the maximum size for KG customers, the limit has been increased to 150MB.

            "content": "Knox Guard 21.03 release notes. Set allow-list for Incoming call on lock screen There is a new option to configure an allow-list for incoming calls for locked devices. This configuration is available in the Default lock screen/PAYG lock screen only, but it will also be applied for Remote, SIM, PAYG and Offline lock cases. This feature allows end users to receive incoming calls from allow-listed numbers even if the device is locked (Customers can add their Customer Support numbers to the allow-list and give guidance/request overdue payment when the device is locked). Per-device auto-lock Currently, the auto-lock option is applied by the tenant meaning all devices registered to a given tenant get locked once this option is enabled. For Knox Guard 1.38, auto-lock can be applied to certain devices in the case where the device is missing/stolen. It is not required to Enable auto-lock again for devices that already have auto-lock applied (the device will continue to have auto-lock applied). This permission is given per Tenant, not device. If a new device is registered, you must select and apply the auto-lock function to that new device manually. Update the lock messages With the KG 1.38 release, customers can update the lock message per device without changing the device state. For normal/AntiTheft tenants, go to Action > Update Lock message. For PAYG tenant, go to Action > Send Relock timestamp. This particular feature is available in Bulk Action menu for multiple devices at once. New information available on 'Device Tab' Device upload/accepted/activated Times and client version There are three device relevant times which are found on the KG customer portal (Device table). These times are: 1. Device uploaded time 2. Device accepted time 3. Device activated time Each device time is available on the Device table as a separate column The Agent version is also available on the Device table so customers are now able to view which version is installed on each device. Inform user of payment complete/Device unlock Customers can notify device users of status changes for better user experience. Messages can be sent when a payment has successfully been completed and the when the device has been unlocked after an overdue payment has been completed. These messages can be customized. This feature is available via the KG console and by API calls. Distinguished enrollment type (URL Enrollment or OOBE) A new menu is available on the SA portal (Samsung Super Admins and Subsidiary Admins can enable/disable this option). Devices where the tenants have enabled 'URL enrollment' permissions can enroll in KG via URL. For existing KG users, URL Enrollment permissions are pre-configured as ON. Improvements to the user flow on the SA portal There have been some usability improvements for the Admin side of the KG client: 1. If the Admin clicks 'Go back to customer table', it returns to the search result rather than the starting page 2. The ability to search a customer by Customer ID has been added Improve activity log to capture all user actions generated in KG portal A new event will be logged whenever the 'Search' function is used and a detailed description containing the search keywords will be generated in the activity log. A new event will also be recorded in the activity log if the user logs out. Improve 'Always show' option for enrollment notification The option to set a non-dismissible message for Enrollment Notice worked only when 'Always show on notification panel' and 'Show after completing enrollment' were selected together. This was not by design because the two options are not dependent on each other. There are two types of notifications: 1. Persistent Notification: Notifications are always displayed on the notification panel once KG is enrolled and users cannot clear this notification as long as the device is enrolled to KG 2. Dismissible Notification: Configured when the enrollment notification is displayed (After enrollment or Device reboot) For KG 1.38, users can set each option separately without the two being dependent. Add customer type for customer analytics Currently, KG categorizes customers as 'End Customer' or 'Samsung Employee'. However, this does not cover all the KG business cases, especially Partnership model cases. Samsung Admins can categorize the customer type (Samsung Employee, End Customer or Partner) and add partner information. 1. Samsung Admins can add Customer type when approving the customer request along with a Tenant type 2. Samsung admins can type or select a partner name after selecting the Customer type Access KG with AD login Credential Because AD login is available within the Knox Portal, customers can access KG with their AD credentials. If the AD is configured and the customer is logged in via AD login: Customer can launch the KG console from the KP Dashboard with their AD credentials (no additional credential is required to launch the KG console) If the AD is disconnected in the Knox Portal: Only Samsung Account login is available for all admins, If admins don't have a Samsung account, then it is required to create a Samsung Account to access the KG portal Back to release notes",

Single API for device upload and SIM policy enabled for easy operation Customers can now apply the SIM policy right after the device is enrolled by using the Upload device API, for example: Add parameter to kcs/v1.1/kg/devices/upload. CSV containing exact information of device shown on KG console Currently, the downloaded CSV files contain detailed device information but some information regarding the device status is not included. For example, if the device's status changes to offline lock, then the device shows as Active/Offline, but the CSV shows the status as Active. Starting with this release, the missing information is now available in the downloaded CSV file. Change the behavior of network verification To support a case where a customer can service multiple networks - For example, multiple MCC/MNC of one carrier - network verification is now changed to two steps: 1. Compare the inserted SIM information with the allow-listed SIM configured from the KG console. 2. Next, compare the network information with the allow-listed SIM's configured information on the device. Once these two steps are completed successfully, the device is unlocked and remains unlocked until it is rebooted or the SIM changes. Lock Screen Customization Starting with this release, the lock screen now has more customizable options to allow customers to support their end-users. Along with making device payments using an app to unlocking the phone, customers can now make calls and access their device information from the lock screen. This update only applies to Android R OS devices. Customize lock message or Relock timestamp for Activating a device Customers can now update the lock message as well as the Relock timestamp for devices that are in the process of activation. This feature is available in the KG portal and the Cloud API as well. 1. KG Portal:'Send Relock timestamp' menu (from Actions) is available for Activating devices. This feature is also available for devices in bulk. 2. Cloud API: Customers can use POST/kcs/v1.1/kg/devices/actions for Activating devices.

Configure multi-SIM policy in single tenant The changes for this upcoming release allow for the configuration of multiple SIM policies: In the current implementation, a configured SIM policy must apply to the device once an admin has Enabled it. The applied policy will be the same for all devices with the enabled SIM policy. Device users can configure multiple SIM policies (max 5). For example, SIM policy 1 could apply to device 1 by the Enable SIM policy function. Another SIM policy 2 could apply to device 2. Device 1 and device 2 would then receive different SIM policies. Change the default duration of Offline lock IT admins can specify how long a device can stay offline before it automatically locks. For the default setting, the value is set to 30 days. The date range for configurable offline days before a device locks has been changed from 15-200 days to 3-200 days. Improved KG notifications To align with existing Knox cloud service solutions and improve the visibility of portal messages/responses, a new Notification Centre has been implemented on KG. The Messaging tab on the KG portal has been replaced with a Notification Centre. Updated notification title If a customer's company name is too long, the displayed notification title will shorten from > Notice from _company name_ to > _Company name_.

This feature enhancement helps in cases where: The device user has lost their previously-allowed SIM card, so you can update the SIM lock policy and push it to their device. The device user has no network connection and they can't configure the connection as the device is locked. By unlocking the phone, they can connect to the network and receive the updated policy.

Overview This knowledge base article provides details on Knox Guard's (KG) Application Installation policy, including how it works and how to enable it in your KG console. What is Knox Guard's Application Installation policy? With the KCS 1.30 release, KG now offers a policy that lets an organization install an application on a user's device for payment and other membership services. This application can be accessed by selecting Advanced support methods on the lock screen that appears when KG locks a device. Ensure you define your application's activity when the device is locked, otherwise it cannot be launched from the lock screen. This policy allows users to make payments when their devices are locked and they have no alternative payment methods. How does Knox Guard's Application Installation policy work? You can configure the Application Installation policy from your KG console. To apply the policy, go to Policies > Application installation, then upload an APK file less than 100 MB in size. To make your uploaded application available on the lock screen, you must also configure the default lock screen policy. In the lock screen policy, select Advanced support methods > Make an application available. Then, set the following parameters: Application package name : Enter the package name of the application you uploaded in the Application Installation policy. Application signature: Enter the signature of the application you uploaded in the Application Installation policy. It must contain at least two segments (one or more dots). You can also select Import APK information to auto-fill the package information. How do I enable Application Installation Policy on my Knox Guard account? Currently, the Application Installation policy is an optional feature in Knox Guard. Please contact your local Samsung Knox Guard administrator to enable it on your account.",

            "content": "About Knox Guard's SIM Control policy. Overview This knowledge base article provides a general overview of Knox Guard's SIM Control policy, and answers some commonly-asked questions about the feature. What is Knox Guard and its SIM Control policy? Knox Guard is a cloud-based service that allows carriers/financial institutions to remotely control and lock Samsung devices to reduce financial risks while running installment plans. From Android 9, the Knox Guard solution also supports a remote SIM Control policy, which allows organizations (e.g. carriers or financial institutions) to restrict certain features on Samsung devices, including locking and unlocking them, using SIM Card attributes. This feature is especially important for operators and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), as the cost of their devices can be subsidized while ensuring that end users cannot use other carrier SIM cards with them. How does Knox Guard's SIM Control policy work? Using Knox Guard, you can configure the SIM Control policy based on the SIM card information below: Mobile Country Code (MCC): Identifies the country that the mobile subscriber resides in. Mobile Network Code (MNC): Identifies the mobile network operator. To uniquely identify a mobile subscriber's network, the MCC is combined with a Mobile Network Code (MNC). Group Identifier Level 1 (GID1): Identifies a particular SIM and handset association, which can be used to classify a group of SIMs involved in a particular application. If the device has a SIM card that matches the MCC and MNC codes listed in Knox Guard, it can be used without restrictions. If your device's SIM card has MCC and MNC codes that do not match the configured codes, Knox Guard either applies restrictions or locks the device. Using Knox Guard, you can apply the following SIM card-based restrictions to the devices you are managing: Lock Device , Restrict Voice Calls , Restrict SMS/MMS/RCS , Restrict SIM data usage The number of MCC/MNC codes you can list is 50. For dual SIM devices, any configured restrictions only apply to an inserted SIM card that does not match the MCC and MNC codes listed in Knox Guard. Once you have configured the SIM Control policy, you can enable it by selecting a number of devices. Device selection can either be done manually or in bulk by uploading a CSV file. You may also choose API integration as an option. What does the SIM Control policy look like in action? Consider that in Knox Guard, you configured and enabled a SIM Control policy to lock a fleet of devices. Once the policy is applied, Knox Guard locks a device if the end user replaces the original SIM card with one from a different operator. Knox Guard detects the unauthorized SIM card, locks the device and displays the following information to the user: A message chosen by the operator , Contact information (i.e. phone number or e-mail address) If the user reinserts the original SIM card associated with the authorized operator, the device unlocks. This policy ensures that users can only use the device with authorized SIM cards. If you apply restrictions to other features such as Voice Calls, SMS/MMS/RCS or Data usage, the operator's message is displayed without locking the device. Can Knox Guard detect when a user changes the SIM Card? Yes. Knox Guard offers device logs, which allow you to check if the SIM card was changed or replaced. How can I enable the SIM Control Policy in my Knox Guard console? Currently, the SIM Control policy is an optional feature of Knox Guard. Please contact your local Samsung Knox Guard administrator to enable it on your account.",

Overview This knowledge base article provides a general overview of Knox Guard's Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy, and answers some commonly-asked questions about this feature. What is Knox Guard and its Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy? Knox Guard is a cloud-based service that allows carriers/financial institutions to remotely control and lock Samsung devices to reduce financial risks while running installment plans. Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy provides controllability to lock the device if a non-designated mobile number (IMSI) SIM card is inserted. This helps to demotivate end-user's fraudulent resale of device. This feature is especially important for operators and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), as the cost of their devices can be subsidized while ensuring that end users cannot use other Mobile Numbers with them, including from the same carrier. Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy is the only viable effective way to prevent illegally selling a device under their finance program. How does Knox Guard's Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy work? Using Knox Guard, you first need to configure a SIM Control policy by specifying MCC and MNC (more info in this article ). Then you can choose \"Turn on mobile number (IMSI) lock\" as an option to Lock the Device. Once Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy is configured, Knox Guard will continuously check for SIM cards that violate the policy. As long as there is an authorized SIM Card inserted in the device (Authorized Carrier or Mobile Number), the device will not be restricted/locked, which includes single SIM or dual SIM models. On the other hand, when KG detects that there is no one authorized SIM Card inserted, then it applies the restriction/lock. It is possible to customize the message displayed on the lock screen, per example when a not allowed SIM is used. To enable/disable Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock, access Knox Guard's console option: Go to Devices > Select devices > Actions > Manage policy > Enable/ Disable SIM Control. Can Knox Guard detect when a user changes his SIM Card even with another SIM Card from the same carrier? Yes. Knox Guard offers device logs, which allow you to check if the SIM card was changed or replaced. How can I enable the Mobile Number (IMSI) Lock Policy in my Knox Guard console?

Overview This article provides details on Knox Guard (KG)'s PIN Unlock feature using PIN, and guides you through the steps on how to generate an unlock PIN from your KG console. What is Knox Guard's PIN Unlock, and when can I use it? PIN Unlock allows you to unlock a device managed by KG without requiring an Internet connection. If you provide a user with a PIN, they can unlock their device by entering it on the KG lock screen. You might want to use PIN Unlock in the following situations: The device is locked due to missed payments and does not have an Internet connection ( Device Status shows as Locked ). A Blinking Reminder is active on the device and cannot be removed as it is not connected to the Internet ( Device Status shows as Reminder ON ). The device is locked because it was offline for the configured period of time ( Device status shows as Offline with the PIN option). How do I get an unlock PIN from the Knox Guard console? The user must first provide you with the device passkey found on their lock or Blinking Reminder screen. Verify that their payment was successful, then generate the unique 8-digit PIN: 1. In the Devices tab of your KG console, find the device you want to unlock. 2. In the Device Status column, select the PIN icon. 3. In the pop-up window, enter the device passkey, then select the checkbox to confirm payment. An 8-digit PIN is shown, which you can instruct the user to enter on their device's lock screen to unlock it.",

            "content": "How to install/update an application on devices through Knox Guard?. Overview The Knox Guard solution has been widely used by carriers and financial institutions to reduce financial risks on installment plans, as with Knox Guard, it is possible to send to devices lack of payment alerts and impose device restrictions. In many situations, companies have an own developed application that is used to allow users make payments. Knox Guard offers a mechanism to push and install an application to enrolled devices so in case device is locked by Knox Guard, the application can be invoked by end user. This article will cover application installation procedure and update. Steps to install an application in device through KG console: Uploading an application at KG console: Access KG console > Policies menu > Advanced Controls > Application Installation option , Browse the application package that should be stored on your PC and select it. The application will be uploaded to KG then select the option \"save\" on the bottom of the page. To update or change an existing application at KG the process is quite similar, so the IT admin should select a different application file (or the same application but with a newer version) by selecting \"Change\" button in the console. Application Installation on devices enrolled on KG Once the application was uploaded at KG console, it is necessary to update the Default Lock Screen Policy to show it. This can be achieved following the path: Access KG console > Policies menu > Device Lock > Default Lock Screen option, At \"Advanced support methods\" select \"Make an app available on lockscreen\" option, then \"Import APK information\". This will link the Lock Screen with the uploaded application. Save the policy The application will be installed/updated on the device as soon as one of the 3 conditions below are met: Heartbeat - Once a day all devices receive a heartbeat signal from KG server, which is used to update their status on the server. The application will be installed/updated on device when the server sends this heartbeat request. It is not possible to determine the exactly time that server sends this type of request. Blink Reminder - Another action that trigger the application installation/update is when a blink reminder notification is issued. This type of message will update the policies applied to the device on server side, so if an application was uploaded on KG console, the device that receives the blink reminder will install/update the application. Lock Device - It is also possible to trigger the application installation/update by sending a Lock device action. This command will make the device update the policies that are applied on KG console including installation/update of the application. In case it is an application update/change, once the IT Admin has uploaded the new application file at KG Console (Policy \"Application Installation\") then he/she needs to reflect the new application file also at \"Default Lock Screen\" Policy by selecting \"Import APK information\" option. How can an End User remove the Application Installed by Knox Guard? Due to security reasons, end users are not allowed to uninstall the application set by KG on their devices. The option to uninstall the application appear greyed out. In case KG IT Admin wants to allow end users to remove the installed application, they should remove the application from Application Installation policy and wait the device get synced with KG server (Heartbeat or the other 2 conditions explained earlier). After that sync, the application can be manually removed by users. How can I enable the Application Installation in my Knox Guard console? Currently, the Application Installation policy is an optional feature of Knox Guard. Please contact your local Samsung Knox Guard administrator to enable it on your account.",

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

            "content": "About single sign-on. Simplify user access management by setting up single sign-on (SSO) for use with Samsung Knox services. As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise. For more information on DualDAR and its unique design, see the DualDAR architecture page.",

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "title": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

            "content": "Trusted Boot. Trusted Boot is a Knox Platform feature representative of Samsung's industry leading mobile device boot protection. Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps. Disable USB-connected updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from booting into Download Mode and installing a manual software update. This restriction includes updates through the Odin, Kies, and Smart Switch update tools.",

With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain. Per-app and device-wide modes - Give specific apps - for example, ones that handle confidential data - stronger firewalls, and all other apps on a device a more lenient firewall configuration. Log unsafe URL access The Knox Platform provides visibility into denied attempts to access blocked domains. The improved visibility helps you to remain aware of potential security breaches or insecure browsing practices within your organization. The Knox Platform logs reports with the following information: App name - The package name of the app attempting to access a blocked domain. Blocked domain URL - The URL of the domain name blocked by your firewall. Timestamp - The time the incident occurred, to assist with troubleshooting incidents.",

The Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated, from partner feedback and industry data, to solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider. The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

This page lists the firewall exceptions that your organization needs to use to securely reach and connect to the Knox server and its supporting resources. It includes the URLs and port numbers that you need to allowlist in order to reach the Knox servers. These server resources can include the following Knox services: _Samsung license Servers_ - When you activate Knox services, devices need to verify their license keys. Devices periodically check their licenses a few times a week. _Samsung SDS IAM & EMM_ - If you're using an EMM, devices will need to access web-based EMM consoles and storage sites. _Samsung ActiveSync Server_ - If you're using Exchange ActiveSync, you'll need an ActiveSync Server connection so the email client can successfully reach the ActiveSync Server. If your organization doesn't permit connections with external servers, you can request an on-premises Knox Server to handle license verification within your firewall. Samsung charges an extra fee for this service. For more information, contact your Samsung representative or reseller. Ports 443 and 80 must be open within your local network domain to reach Knox server resources. Knox Cloud Services can utilize both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Firebase. Both services may also warrant adding to the allowlist within your organization's firewall policy. For information on the AWS that may require allowlist inclusion, see https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to. Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account. Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service. Once you're finished editing, click SAVE to record your changes. Alternatively, you can choose to delete the role. Click DELETE at the bottom of the page to remove the role from the list and remove the associated permissions for all admins who are assigned to the role. Note that this action can't be undone.",

Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

For more information, refer to the Knox Guard admin guide. Device deletion from all Knox cloud services Prior to 22.11, if a device needed to be removed from all subscribed Knox services, it had to be deleted from each service individually. Now, admins with the Manage devices and Delete permissions and access to all Knox cloud services can delete a device on the centralized device information page after searching for it. Enhancements to Knox Manage admin management The 22.11 release adds the ability for Knox Admin Portal admins to resend and revoke invitations for new Knox Manage admins in your tenant, as well as deactivate and reactivate current Knox Manage admins, on the consolidated Administrators & Roles page.

To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Updates to Samsung Knox and Knox Admin Portal enrollment The My Knox dashboard is now deprecated, and the Samsung Knox and Knox Admin Portal enrollment flows are streamlined to reduce the barrier of entry and provide a cohesive user experience. When a new user signs into their Knox account for the first time, they're greeted with a welcome screen and can select services they want to see and use in the Knox Admin Portal. This new onboarding flow also replaces the Knox Admin Portal auto-tour. Knox Admin Portal homepage After you sign in to Samsung Knox, you are now greeted by a new homepage that contains guidance about how to get started with Knox services, including links to the latest features and support resources. All tools and resources that were previously found on the My Knox dashboard are also available through this homepage. You can set the landing page to be either the new homepage or the dashboard of a Knox service in Settings. To return to the homepage at any time, click Knox Admin Portal in the top-left corner or Home in the navigation pane.

Support for admin deletion To help control privileges and maintain the roster of admins, the 23.06 release introduces the ability to remove admin accounts of your Knox services. Super admins and admins with the Invite and manage administrators permission for all relevant services can now delete other admins, except for super admins, from the Knox Admin Portal. If you have the correct permissions, you can delete an admin by clicking their name in the admin list to edit their details, then clicking MORE ACTIONS > Delete account. This action isn't available if you don't have the correct permissions. Knox Admin Portal access for Knox Guard users In previous releases, due to technical limitations, admins who worked in a tenant that only had Knox Guard as a service couldn't access the Knox Admin Portal. As of the 23.06 release, if Knox Guard is the sole service in your tenant, you can now perform your administrative duties on the Knox Admin Portal. To quickly access the Knox Admin Portal, click Customer portal > Knox Admin Portal on the Knox Guard console. Note that only the following features of the Knox Admin Portal are available for Knox Guard users: The support center , The account details, which include options to: Edit account settings , Show or hide services, where you can also select other Knox services to register for and use on the Knox Admin Portal , Customize the default landing page Knox Remote Support The following release notes describe functionality for Knox Remote Support when accessed through the Knox Admin Portal, and not through the Knox Manage console. #Device list Knox Remote Support now provides a page called Devices, which is a launchpad for starting remote sessions with any device in your enterprise that was both enrolled and configured through an EMM, and currently has the Knox Remote Support agent installed. When you launch Knox Remote Support from the Knox Admin Portal, this page is now the default view. To learn more about the workings and efficiencies offered by the Devices page, see Manage Knox Remote Support devices. #Notification-based and automatic sessions Previously, a support session could only start when the device user opened the Knox Remote Support agent on the device and manually entered an access code that you provided to them. Starting with the 23.06 release, you can initiate a remote session with two new methods available on the Devices page: Ask Users to Start - Sends a push notification to the device with a prompt to start a session, and the device user can tap it to begin. Automatically Start - Immediately starts a support session on the device, without the user's input. This method is only available on Samsung devices that support Knox. Back to release notes",

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

            "content": "About Secured by Knox, Android - Others and Android Go devices. Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process.

If your device was previously enrolled using the + gesture, after performing a factory reset on the device, attempting to use the + gesture to enroll the device again results in this error. Resolution If a device has already been enrolled with the + gesture, you do not need to use the gesture to enroll it again as the device already exists in your account. From your KC or KME admin console, you can assign a profile to the device. Once you factory reset the device, the profile is automatically downloaded after the device connects to a network during the setup wizard.

Although the support for the oldest version is no longer available on every first major release in the year, Knox solutions are supported on the latest five major Android versions. With this change, we commit to: 1. Maintain the best-in-class product quality by focusing our resources on the versions that majority of you use. 2. Enhance the security of Knox products by restricting the supported versions to recent ones that have valid security patches from OS or hardware. Exceptions , Knox Platform for Enterprise is supported from Knox 2.4 and each feature is dependent on the specific Knox version. Knox Manage is supported from seven major Android versions (6-12) as of March 2022. To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted. You may continue to use Knox products on such devices, but the Samsung teams won't provide support for issues on those devices. For security and performance, we recommend upgrading your Android devices to meet the minimum supported version requirements. Supported versions for each Knox solution _Last updated March 22, 2023_ The following table lists the minimum supported Android version for each Knox product.
