            "content": "Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Authentication Manager is and how it works. What is Knox Authentication Manager? Knox Authentication Manager is a managed, Android autofill service for shared, fully managed Samsung devices. Knox Authentication Manager offers multiuser facial biometrics to speed-up shared device sign-ins, eliminates authentication friction by saving and automatically filling user credentials for any productivity app that requires manual sign-in, and securely syncs users' profiles across shared devices. Profile sync enables users to enroll once on a single device, then pick up any other device and instantly make it their own for the duration of their shift. Knox Authentication Manager has features in place to help keep personal data secure. With profile syncing, no data is stored to the cloud or a server. Device syncing is coordinated through device groups that are defined by admins or auto-defined based on Wi-Fi subnets. Device groups typically map to facilities where a group of users share devices. To sync, devices must be able to communicate with each other via Wi-Fi and reach Google Firebase, though no Google Firebase account or subscription is required by your enterprise or users. How does it work? Knox Authentication Manager works with your UEM to capture users' enterprise sign-in credentials. New users first sign in to a UEM shared device launcher or Azure AD and then register for Knox Authentication Manager. Knox Authentication Manager allows two different sign-in methods for devices, face and manual. Face sign-in directs users to enter a PIN number and scan their face to sign in. Manual sign-in requires users to sign in with their enterprise credentials. Admins can choose which method to enable via their UEM. After registration, users allow Knox Authentication Manager to save their credentials for any productivity apps that require sign-in and align with the Knox Authentication Manager sign-in flows. The next time they sign in to a device in your fleet, Knox Authentication Manger automatically signs them in to any apps for which they saved their credentials. When a user's session on a device ends, the device is ready for the next user to sign in to and use. Knox Authentication Manager thus benefits enterprises that have shift work because it allows users working at different times of the day to seamlessly use the same devices.

Knox Authentication Manager is a managed app for shared Samsung devices that provides multiuser facial biometrics and sign-in automation for increased frontline worker productivity and safety. Supported UEMs and management types Knox Authentication Manager works with the following UEM solutions using fully managed devices with access to Managed Google Play: UEM solution , Main sign-in method - , - VMware Workspace ONE , Launcher Microsoft Intune , Managed Home Screen SOTI MobiControl , Customer Azure AD credentials1 - devices must be in kiosk mode (Lockdown) Samsung Knox Manage , Customer Azure AD credentials1 - devices must be in kiosk mode 1 When using SOTI or Knox Manage with Knox Authentication Manager, you need an Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, sign up on the Microsoft Azure portal page. Required network capabilities See below for the network requirements for Knox Authentication Manager: Groups of devices must be able to communicate with one another through Wi-Fi for device-to-device syncing. Devices must be able to reach Google Firebase to coordinate syncing (no subscription is needed). If your enterprise is behind a firewall, you must add our Knox servers to your firewall's allowlist. For details, see Firewall exceptions. Since Knox Authentication Manager communicates with Firebase using HTTPS, you should add port 443, the standard port for HTTPS transmissions, and URLs that end with \\*.firebaseio.com to your firewall's allowlist. Knox Authentication Manager uses UDP and TLS protocols for device communication and data exchange over port numbers. The default ports for UDP are 49158 and 49159, and the default port number for TLS is 7788, but these ports can be customized. Add these ports, or the ones you set, to your firewall's allowlist. When you set up Knox Authentication Manager in your UEM, you need to create a shared key to encrypt and protect user profiles and device group communication. One way to generate this key is through OpenSSL. Mac and Linux users can run `openssl rand -base64 24` in a terminal. Windows users first have to install OpenSSL. See the OpenSSL documentation for more information. Required license A valid Knox Suite license key is required to use Knox Authentication Manager. For more information, see Get started as an IT admin. Additionally, to ensure that Knox Authentication Manager performs optimally, admins should configure specific Knox Service Plugin policies with their UEM. For more information on Knox Service Plugin requirements, see Get started as an IT admin and Knox Service Plugin.

Step 1: Register a user account and start using Knox Authentication Manager Learn how to register your account with Knox Authentication Manager and save your sign-in credentials for apps. #Register a user account with face sign-in To register your account when face sign-in is enabled and configured: 1. Unlock your device. Knox Authentication Manager automatically launches on devices managed by VMware Workspace ONE. Knox Authentication Manager doesn't automatically launch on devices managed by Knox Manage or SOTI unless your IT admin configured it to. In this case, open the app and tap Sign in or enroll. If this is the first time Knox Authentication Manager is used on a device, two notifications will pop up on the device which ask you to allow Knox Authentication Manager to send notifications and get camera access. If you don't allow Knox Authentication Manager camera access while using the app, you and other users won't be able to use face sign-in on the device. 2. Enter your enterprise username on the Knox Authentication Manager dialog and then click Next. On the next screen, sign in using your enterprise credentials. For VMware, your enterprise credentials are the credentials you use to sign in to VMware. For SOTI and Knox Manage, your enterprise credentials are your Azure AD credentials. Then click Next. The device switches back to Knox Authentication Manager once you sign in. 3. On the pop up, tap Allow if you agree to let Knox Authentication Manager use the Google Accessibility Service. 4. On the Samsung Knox Authentication Manager pop up, if you agree to let the app capture and store your biometric data, select the round checkbox and tap I Accept. 5. Next, proceed through the prompts to register your PIN and face sign-in credentials. 6. Once your account is registered, whenever you sign in to an app for the first time, Knox Authentication Manager will offer to save your credentials for next time. When Knox Authentication Manager prompts you to save the sign-in information for the app, tap Save to save the app's credentials. Knox Authentication Manager can only save the credentials for a single user account per app. #Register a user account with manual sign-in To register a user account when face sign-in is disabled: 1. Unlock your device or launch Knox Authentication Manager. Enter your enterprise username on the Knox Authentication Manager dialog. Then click Next. 2. On the next screen, sign in using your enterprise credentials. Then click Next. The device switches back to Knox Authentication Manager once you sign in. 3. On the pop up, tap Allow if you to agree to let Knox Authentication Manager use the Google Accessibility Service. 4. On the Samsung Knox Authentication Manager pop up, tap I Accept if you agree to let Knox Authentication Manager save your app credentials. 5. Once your account is registered, whenever you sign in to an app for the first time, Knox Authentication Manager will offer to save your credentials for next time. When Knox Authentication Manager prompts you to save the sign in information for the app, tap Save. Step 2: Sign in and out of Knox Authentication Manager This section describes how to sign in and out of Knox Authentication Manager. Each time you pick up a shared device at the start of your shift, you need to sign in to Knox Authentication Manager to access your profile and settings. #Sign-in with your PIN and face To sign in to Knox Authentication Manager with your PIN and face: 1. Unlock your device or launch Knox Authentication Manager. Enter your enterprise credentials and click Next. 2. Enter your PIN and scan your face to authenticate. 3. When you open any app for which you have saved sign-in information for, Knox Authentication Manager automatically signs in to it. #Sign-in manually To sign in to Knox Authentication Manager using your UEM or Azure AD credentials: 1. Unlock your device or launch Knox Authentication Manager. Enter your enterprise ID and click Next. 2. Knox Authentication Manager auto-fills the username in the shared device launcher or Azure AD sign-in dialog, after which you must enter your password. 3. When you open any app for which you have saved sign-in information for, Knox Authentication Manager automatically signs in to it. #Sign out To sign out of Knox Authentication Manager and manually end the shared-device session: For VMware - End your session by signing out of the UEM launcher. If your admin configured it to, the launcher may sign you out automatically. For SOTI and Knox Manage - Open the Knox Authentication Manager app and tap Sign out on the home screen or pull down the notification drawer on your device and tap the Knox Authentication Manager notification to sign out. If your admin configured it to, Knox Authentication Manager may end your session automatically if you've been inactive for too long or you plug in your device. When you're finished with a device, you should always sign out manually to ensure it can sync with other devices once on charge, regardless of how your admin configured Knox Authentication Manager. Step 3: Manage app credentials Learn how to manage your app credentials in Knox Authentication Manager. To ensure that Knox Authentication Manager captured your sign-in credentials for any apps that you signed in to: 1. Open the app, go to the menu, and tap Manage credentials. Check that all the apps for which you saved your sign-in information are listed. To delete your saved sign-in credentials: 1. Open the app and navigate to Manage credentials. Select one or more apps, then tap Delete. 2. Sign-out of Knox Authentication Manager. Then sign back in and open the app or apps for which you deleted your sign-in information to ensure that Knox Authentication Manager doesn't autofill your sign-in credentials. When Knox Authentication Manager saves your credentials for productivity apps, it associates them with a package name or an auth URL. If multiple apps share the same auth URL, there may be a single entry for those apps under Manage credentials. If productivity apps share the same auth URL with the main login identity server, there is no entry, and the productivity app logins will be automated since the credentials were already saved during registration.",

            "content": "Get started as an IT admin. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins and guides you through the basics of setting up Knox Authentication Manager. Step 1: Get a Knox Suite license A valid Knox Suite license is required to use Knox Authentication Manager. To get a Knox Suite license: 1. Sign up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't done so already. Refer to Create a Samsung account to learn more. 2. Next, Apply for access to Knox Suite. After you apply, a trial license is automatically generated for you, which covers 30 active devices and expires after three months. Once your trial license expires, you can purchase a commercial Knox Suite license from your local reseller. For more information on Knox Suite licenses, see Confirm and register your license. Additionally, you must ensure your enterprise devices have access to Samsung Knox servers. When you activate Knox services, your enrolled devices will verify their license keys and exchange data with the Knox servers. Devices periodically check their licenses a few times a week. Step 2: Set up Knox Service Plugin To ensure that Knox Authentication Manager performs optimally, admins should configure specific Knox Service Plugin policies with their UEM. For more information on Knox Service Plugin requirements, see Knox Service Plugin. For instructions on how to set up Knox Service Plugin with your UEM, see its documentation. Step 3: Set up your UEM Knox Authentication Manager requires devices to be set up in a particular way, depending on your UEM. Read on to learn about how to set up these methods for your respective UEM. #VMware Workspace ONE To work with VMware Workspace ONE, Knox Authentication Manager requires devices to be set up with the Workspace ONE Launcher. For more information, see About VMware Workspace ONE Launcher in the UEM's documentation. #SOTI MobiControl To work with SOTI MobiControl, Knox Authentication Manager requires devices to be set up in Lockdown. Lockdown, or lockdown mode, is a means of setting up a dedicated device, and is similar to kiosk mode in Knox Manage. It limits device access to a home screen with approved apps and web pages. For more information, see Lockdown (Android Enterprise-Work Managed) in the SOTI MobiControl documentation. #Microsoft Intune To work with Microsoft Intune, Knox Authentication Manager requires devices to be set up with the Intune Managed Home Screen app. For more information, see Configure Managed Home Screen app in the Microsoft Intune documentation. #Knox Manage To work with Knox Manage, Knox Authentication Manager requires devices to be set up in kiosk mode. Kiosk mode is a means of setting up a dedicated device, by constraining the device's functionality to suit that of an on-premises or embedded computer. For more information, see Create a kiosk in the Knox Manage documentation. Step 4: Add Knox Authentication Manager as a managed app in your UEM To add Knox Authentication Manager from Google Play as a managed app through your UEM, see the pages below. VMware Workspace ONE, SOTI MobiControl, Microsoft Intune, Knox Manage For Knox Manage and SOTI MobiControl environments, you have to register Knox Authentication Manager in the Azure portal.

If you use SOTI MobiControl or Knox Manage, add Knox Authentication Manager to the kiosk profile or configure them in Lockdown before you deploy to your devices. Additionally, you should configure the below settings in your UEM. Ensure that any Knox Authentication Manager-related activities are enabled in your UEM. Set the Knox Service Plugin Package Name for Auto-Launch policy to auto-launch Knox Authentication Manager. See the UEM guides for instructions on how to set up Knox Service Plugin with your UEM. Add Knox Authentication Manager to the Knox Service Plugin Force Stop Blocklist policy so users can't force stop Knox Authentication Manager. Add Knox Authentication Manager to the Knox Service Plugin Battery optimization allowlist policy to exempt it from battery usage optimizations that could suspend its process. Exclude Knox Authentication Manager from clean up, which may delete inactive device records, if you use VMware or Intune. This policy is available with the Knox Service Plugin 23.06 release. To use this policy, a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license is required, which is available at no cost with a Knox Suite license. To learn more, see Knox Platform for Enterprise licenses. To ensure Knox Authentication Manager performs optimally: Allow Knox Authentication Manager main activity if you use VMware to allow the Knox Authentication Manager sign-in screen to pop up before the user signs in to the VMware launcher. For SOTI MobiControl and Knox Manage, if users use Microsoft 365 accounts, ensure that you or the user don't set the account to stay signed in. Step 6: Test devices and device syncing After you deploy Knox Authentication Manager, test that Knox Authentication Manager works as expected. Unlock a device. Knox Authentication Manager automatically launches on devices managed by VMware Workspace ONE. Knox Authentication Manager doesn't automatically launch on devices managed by Knox Manage or SOTI unless you configured it to. In this case, open the app and click Sign in or enroll. A dialog should pop up asking users to enter their enterprise username. Once you know Knox Authentication Manager works as expected, test that Knox Authentication Manager syncs across your devices. You need two devices with Knox Authentication Manager installed that are in the same device group or on the same Wi-Fi subnet, depending on how you configured Knox Authentication Manager in your UEM. These devices are referred to as Device A and Device B below. 1. Dock or plug in Device B. When you charge a device, a Starting sync service notification appears on its lock screen. 2. Enroll a new user account with Knox Authentication Manager on Device A. To learn how to enroll for Knox Authentication Manager as an end user, see Get started as a user. 3. Dock or plug in Device A and wait 1-2 minutes for the devices to sync. 4. On Device B, enter the enterprise credentials you used to create the new user account on Device A in Knox Authentication Manager. If Knox Authentication Manager signs in without asking you to enroll the account, then the devices synced successfully. For more information on device syncing, see Troubleshoot device syncing.",

            "content": "Troubleshoot device syncing. This page outlines how to test that your devices sync properly. Prerequisites Synchronization between shared devices happens when all of the following conditions are met: The devices have the same group ID or are on the same Wi-Fi subnet, depending on how you configured Knox Authentication Manager in your UEM. The devices are charging. Your network's configuration and firewall allows devices to communicate with one another using the UDP and TCP port numbers specified in the managed configuration. Port 443 and URLs that end with \\*.firebaseio.com have been added to your firewall's allowlist to allow communication with Firebase. Test device syncing To test device syncing, you need two devices with Knox Authentication Manager installed that are in the same device group or on the same Wi-Fi subnet, depending on how you configured Knox Authentication Manager in your UEM. For instruction purposes, these devices will be referred to as Device A and Device B. 1. Dock or plug in Device B. 2. Enroll a new user account with Knox Authentication Manager on Device A. 3. Dock or plug in Device A and wait 1-2 minutes for the devices to sync. 4. On Device B, enter the enterprise ID you used to create the new user account on Device A. If Knox Authentication Manager signs in to the account without asking you to re-enroll the account, then the devices synced successfully. Potential issues #Network related issues Devices may not sync if: The UDP/TCP port number is blocked by your enterprise's network policy. HTTPS or port 443 is blocked so devices can't communicate with Google Firebase. #Device related issues Devices may not sync if: A device's storage is full. A device has lower than 5% power. A device's storage is encrypted. Since Knox Authentication Manager's application data is stored in the Credential Encrypted (CE) storage location, if a device is rebooted but not unlocked, the CE storage is encrypted. #Configuration related issues Devices may not sync if in the Knox Authentication Manager configuration in your UEM: Devices aren't under the same org ID, group ID, and group key. The UDP/TCP port number is invalid or conflicts with other services on the device. #Charge related issues Devices may not sync if: A device was just charged out of the network range. A device was powered off when charged.",
