            "content": "Manage licenses. You must purchase a license to use Knox Configure. As with other Knox licenses, you can request a Knox Configure license from the sales team in your country. Once purchased, you enter their license on the Knox Configure console. A license is applied and activated automatically when a device is accepted into Knox Configure. When a Knox Configure license expires, the devices mapped to the expired license are automatically released from Knox Configure management control. License utilization is global, and not restricted by regional device deployment constraints. Once you've uploaded your purchased devices to Knox Configure, you need to create a configuration profile and select a license to ensure a Samsung Knox-compliant deployment. Two following license types are available for utilization with Knox Configure: For new customers, Knox Configure currently only supports the license types mentioned below. However, if you're actively using a legacy Knox Configure license, your legacy license will continue to be supported. _Trial license_ - Trial licenses are intended for development and testing before going live with your deployment. Trial licenses are valid for 3 months and cannot exceed 30 devices for either Setup or Dynamic edition Knox Configure profile usage. Trial licenses can be migrated to commercial licenses upon expiration by contacting your reseller. _Commercial license_ - Use a commercial license when deploying devices for commercial use with either a Setup or Dynamic Knox Configure profile. Commercial licenses must be purchased from a Knox reseller supporting your geographic deployment region. A _Per Device_ license is the standard license type for the Setup and Dynamic editions of Knox Configure. Per Device licenses include a finite number of non-transferable seats, which means that once a device has been assigned with this license type, the seat can't be reassigned. Per device licenses also have uniform scheduling, so all devices assigned with this license type expire on the same date. A Setup edition _Per Device (Staggered)_ license enables you to utilize licenses more efficiently, since you may not initially use Knox Configure after purchase or deploy all of your devices at the same time. Using a Per Device (Staggered) license type, you create a Setup edition profile and assign devices as usual. However, you then select the Per Device (Staggered) license type and ensure each activated device has a different expiration date based on the device's activation date. A Dynamic edition _Per Seat_ license enable you to revoke a license on one device to use the license, per seat, on another device with the same Dynamic edition profile. For example, you may want to revoke an ex-employee's license so you can utilize that revoked license on a different device using that same Dynamic edition profile. Utilizing the revoked license increases the available license count and improves license provisioning efficiency with the Dynamic edition profile. The following chart compares the different license types for each edition of Knox Configure: Setup Edition Dynamic Edition License name Setup Edition Setup Edition (Staggered) Dynamic Edition Dynamic Edition (Per Seat) License type Per Device Per Device (Staggered) Per Device Per Seat Valid license period All device licenses expire at the same time License period guaranteed per each device All device licenses expire at the same time Transferable? No Yes License extension Available Not available Available Increase/decrease number of devices during license period Increase only Increase and decrease A profile and an assigned license are now no longer linked, and each device follows the behavior of the license types they belong to. Legacy SKUs and new license SKUs can now be used together in the same profile. If necessary, a profile can be created and saved without a license assignment. To review existing licenses: 1. Select Licenses from the left-hand navigation menu. Devices don't consume new license seats when re-assigned to profiles that use the same license. However, devices need to be manually selected within the Knox Configure console and re-assigned the license. Therefore, you can re-assign an unassigned device to a profile and re-use a renewed license without consuming additional license seats. 2. Review the following license utilization information to assess whether an existing license can be used: _LICENSE NAME_ - Lists the name assigned to license upon creation or edit. The name displays as a link that can selected to review license data in greater detail. For more information, see License details. _TYPE_ - Lists the type of license purchased. License types can be filtered as needed to drill-down to particular types, and include _Setup Trial_, _Setup Commercial_, _Setup (Staggered)_ _Trial_, _Setup (Staggered),_ _Dynamic Trial_, _Dynamic Commercial_, _Dynamic (per seat) Trial,_ _Dynamic (per seat)_, _Dynamic Enterprise_, _Custom SDK_, and _Custom SDK (KLM)_. A single profile can have multiple devices using it, with each device potentially using a different license type. Select CLEAR FILTER as needed to reset the filtering preferences. _STATUS_ - Displays the _Active_, _Registered_, or _Expired_ status of each listed license. Select CLEAR FILTER as needed to reset the filtering preferences. _PURCHASED SEATS_ - Lists the total number of purchased seats that can utilized with this license. This is the number prior to device assignment. With trial licenses, this number will be 30. _REMAINING SEATS_ - Displays the number of remaining purchased seats that are not yet assigned to a device and activated. Licenses with no remaining seats still display within the Knox Configure Licenses screen, but not in the profile creation flow when selecting a license to assign to a profile. _ASSIGNED SEATS_ - Lists the number of devices currently assigned a profile but that haven't yet been activated using the license. Click the number of assigned seats to open the Devices screen and view the device ID and profile assignments of devices assigned with this license. _ACTIVATED SEATS_ - Lists the number of seats out of the total purchased that have been activated for use with a deployed device and its profile. _ACTIVATION END_ - Displays the end date when license seats can no longer be assigned and activated under the terms of this listed license. When a license reaches its activation end date, the assigned count matches the number of remaining devices assigned profiles. When a license activation end date changes, a console notification informs of the new activation end date. 3. Having reviewed the contents of the License screen, either use an existing listed license, Get a license, or Enter a license key. License details A listed license can be selected to reviewed in greater detail. To review license details: 1. Select Licenses from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Refer to the LICENSE NAME column and select the link of an existing license to review it in greater detail. 3. The License details screen displays the following: _License Name_ - Lists the name assigned to license upon creation. The name can be edited if need be. The right side of the screen displays whether this selected license is currently active, registered, or expired. _Seats_ - Displays the number of seats purchased with this selected license. If needed, contact your reseller to increase the number of seats. The number of remaining seats also displays along with the number both assigned and activated with a device and its profile. _License Key_ - Displays the License Key used as a unique alphanumeric code to activate this specific license. Before you enter a Commercial key you should ensure the Trial key is deleted. _Type_ - Displays whether the selected license is a Setup/Dynamic Trial or Commercial license. Trial licenses are temporary and subject to expiration upon the Activation End Date. Commercial licenses are perpetual and not subject to expiration. Trial licenses can also be deleted from the Knox Configure console when they are no longer required for device testing. A single profile can have multiple devices using it, with each device potentially using a different license type. _Owner_ - Lists the owner email address of the enterprise using Knox Configure to configure and deploy devices using this license. _Activation Start Date_ - Defines the beginning date and time a license can be activated for device license seat allocation. The Activation Start Date begins the expiration countdown of a trial license activation period. _Activation End Date_ - Lists the end date of the license seat activation period under the terms of this selected license. When a license reaches its activation end date, the assigned count matches the number of remaining devices assigned profiles. After this date, this license cannot be used to assign or activate additional devices. Devices that have already been activated with this license can remain active for the remainder activation period. _Activation Period_ - Lists the activation duration period for the selected license. 4. Select OK if needed to save the updates to the License Name and return to the Licenses screen. Get a license To obtain a Trial (temporary) or Commercial (permanent) Knox Configure license: 1. Select Licenses from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the GET A LICENSE button from the top right-hand side of the screen. 3. Select GENERATE TRIAL LICENSE and one of the enabled options to use a trial license with either your Setup or Dynamic edition profile. 4. Select FIND RESELLER to search for a Knox reseller in you specific geographic region that supports your intended Knox Configure device and profile feature set deployment. Enter a license key To enter a license key in order to add a license to a profile: From July 31, 2021, you can't generate an Enterprise Edition license. These are replaced by Knox Suite licenses. As a result, when assigning licenses to EE devices, you can assign a normal (non-EE) Knox Configure license. You can continue to assign any legacy EE licenses to devices launched before August 2021. To determine whether a device model is eligible for EE, you can now check to see if it has an Eligible for Enterprise Edition tag. On the Device Details panel, devices are now auto-tagged to differentiate between old and new EE devices. Old EE devices are tagged with Enterprise Edition and 1 more. When you hover over the 1 more tag, it displays Eligible for Enterprise Edition. New EE devices are only tagged with Enterprise Edition. The EE tags are displayed first, followed by other tags in alphabetical order. For more information on tags, see Device details and logs. An IT admin can now add a new KLM license (for customization APIs) prior to its actual activation date. This enables the admin to optimally register the license and assign a profile and devices before the license activation date. A pop-up warning message displays stating the activation date for the license has not yet started. 1. Within Knox Configure, select Licenses from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. If you don't already have a license, select the GET A LICENSE button from the top, right-hand side, of the screen. To test your profiles, select Dynamic or Setup and select GENERATE TRIAL LICENSE. To deploy profiles to your users, select FIND RESELLER to purchase a production license from a reseller in your geographic region. 3. If you already have a license, select the ENTER LICENSE KEY button from the top, right-hand side, of the screen. 4. Enter a License name and License key. The license name is just a label for the license key, it does not impact the license functionality in any way. The license name must be unique to any other license name used with your specific deployment. 5. Click ADD. License expiry _Per Device_, _Per Device (Staggered)_, and _Per Seat_ licenses all include a 30-day grace period to accommodate license renewal delays. During the grace period, you can't reboot, factory reset, or push profile updates and lock/unlock commands to associated devices. Any previously scheduled pushes will also fail. After the 30-day grace period, device behavior depends on the license the device was set up with: _Per Device and Per Device (Staggered)_ - The device is automatically unassigned, but all policies added to the device remain on the device. Device policies remain active until the device undergoes a factory reset or its profile is synced. _Per Seat_ - The device is automatically unassigned and all policies are revoked, which removes all restrictions from the device. All content, apps, and non-restrictive configurations such as boot animations and hardware key remaps remain on the device after the device is unassigned. A device can be unassigned from its assigned profile when the device is using a staggered license, and the service period has ended, or when the device is using a non-staggered license, and the 30-day license expiration grace period has ended. Replace a license Complete the following steps if you are: Switching all devices on one license to another (useful when replacing licenses that are about to expire) 1. Select the license you would like to replace. 2. On the Licenses screen, select Replace license. 3. Select the new license to replace the previous license. Switch configured devices to a different license Complete the following steps if you are: Switching from a trial license to a commercial license, Switching from a commercial license to a different commercial license 1. From within the Licenses screen, select the ENTER LICENSE KEY button. Add the new license key to the list of available licenses. 2. Select the name of the profile to utilize with your devices. If configuring the device to the same profile it used previously, you will need to clone the profile, as it is not possible to change licenses using the same profile. To clone a profile, navigate to the Profiles screen and select the checkbox beside the profile name you would like to clone. Select Clone to edit from the ACTIONS drop-down menu. 3. Navigate to the Profiles screen and select specific devices. Select Assign devices from the ACTIONS drop-menu. 4. From the Select devices screen, select the devices you want to assign. If you cannot find a particular device, ensure you are not filtering the devices by status. 5. Select the ASSIGN button once all the devices you intend to assign are selected. 6. Select NO when the Change assigned profile screen prompts whether you want to continue using the existing license. Knox Deployment App license utilization You can also assign for use with the Knox Deployment App while you create or edit a profile on the Enrollment info page. You can only designate one license at a time for the Knox Deployment App, so if the license is consumed or expired, you'll need to assign another one. If there are no licenses listed in the License menu, click + Enter License Key and enter your license details. You can now select the newly created license for use with the Knox Deployment App. The License menu includes both active licenses with remaining seats and licenses that have yet to start. If you select a license that has yet to start, you'll see an error message that warns you not to use this license and instead select an active license with seats remaining.",

Start tutorial About Knox Configure Knox Configure is available in separate editions: Setup edition Setup edition supports one-time configuration of enrolled devices and settings. To change a device configuration after initial policies are set, devices must be factory resettled and new policies must be re-applied. Setup edition includes a select subset of the policies and settings available in the Dynamic edition's normal mode. Dynamic edition Knox Configure Dynamic edition allows you to deploy and update enrolled device policies as many times as needed without a factory reset. Supported features include ProKiosk mode, Enterprise Billing, Knox Shared Devices and numerous other enhancements. Dynamic edition includes all the policies and settings available in the Setup edition, plus many more. Prerequisites Following prerequisites must be satisfied to use Knox Configure: Knox Configure portal doesn't support these special characters: \\# / $ \\* % ^ & \\\\ ( ) + ? [ ] Ensure they are not used when inputting characters into the portal. 1. Supported phones, tablets or wearable devices purchased from a participating reseller in the Knox Deployment Program. If you are not sure whether your reseller is participating in the program, contact the reseller or a Samsung Sales Representative for more information. 2. The appropriate Knox licenses purchased from a Knox Reseller (for commercial deployment). 3. A Knox account. For more information, see Sign up for Knox Configure. 4. The correct firewall exemptions needed to extend beyond your local and protected network domain and securely connect to the Knox Configure server. For more information, see Knox Configure firewall exceptions. 5. A supported browser (Edge, Firefox, or Chrome). The deployment process Using a web-based console, IT admins create profiles with the device settings, restrictions, apps, and other content to be deployed to groups of devices. After devices have been successfully enrolled in the enterprise, they receive device profiles via Wi-Fi or mobile data. This image below outlines the Knox Configure deployment process flow: Once a profile is configured, it can be assigned to specific Knox Configure managed devices. Device assignment is the final step in the configuration process, though devices can be locked by carriers and resellers post deployment. For more information, see Assign and deploy a profile to device. Device states Devices that are submitted to Knox Configure progress through the following states when assigned profiles and configurations are pushed to the device: For information on a selected device's unique device details and device log, see Device details and logs. Unassigned - The device is uploaded to Knox Configure, but there are no profiles yet assigned or a previously applied profile has been unassigned. Profile assigned - A profile was assigned to the device, but the device is yet to be configured. For example, the device may not have been powered on since a profile has been assigned. In progress - A device profile assignment has been made and the subsequent device configuration is in progress and pending completion. Error - A problem was encountered during device configuration rendering. For more information, see Configuration errors. Canceled by user - The end user has skipped the device profile configuration. It must be restarted to configure the device. Configured - The device has successfully received Knox Configure profile or the profile update has been pushed successfully. Failed to configure - Device has failed to receive the profile, or a profile update was not successfully pushed. Updates pushed - A profile update has been pushed to the device, but the device is still processing the update. Locked - The device is locked in Knox Configure. Either IT admin can unlock the device or the device end user can input the provided password. Locked devices remain in their locked state even after the device's profile is unassigned. Exchanging - The device had its device ID swapped. This device needs its profile re-assigned and updated back to an Assigned state. Deactivated temporarily - The device has been temporarily deactivated by the IT admin to review and assess an issue before the device is activated again. Once you have signed in to Knox Configure for the first time, you will encounter both the Knox Configure get started carousel and auto tour. These resources display only when a new user initially signs in to Knox Configure, and are designed to assist new users in understanding central Knox Configure functions and better navigate the Knox Configure console. For more information, see Knox Configure carousel and auto tour. When using Knox Mobile Enrollment with Knox Configure, be careful when unchecking the Leave all system apps enabled checkbox (from within the Knox Mobile Enrollment Device Owner profile settings screen), as this may lead to conflicts with Knox Configure. For example, when setting the Samsung browser homepage, the Knox Configure policy will fail [51010] if system apps are disabled (since system apps include the Samsung browser).",

This feature allows for easy Knox Configure enrollment and profile configuration through accessory pairing. With Knox Configure Accessories, accessory manufacturers and Samsung partners can easily implement accessories to instantly configure devices. Knox Configure Accessories send a code to devices that are associated with a configured profile that can enroll the device independent of the device's upload status on the Reseller Portal. Examples of accessories include phone cases and NFC cards. This feature is available for devices running Android 10 and higher. You can set up accessory enrollment when you create a profile or it can be added to an existing profile. To set up accessory enrollment: 1. Create a new profile or edit an existing profile. 2. On the Enrollment info page, scroll down to DEVICE ENROLLMENT and click ADD ACCESSORY. 3. You're prompted to generate a UID for the device. The device UID is a unique identifier that defines the product policy for each accessory. In the Generate UID dialog, fill the following fields: Accessory type - Select an accessory type. The available types are Cover and NFC card / Buds case. Total serial number quantity - Enter the maximum number of accessories that can be associated with a profile, up to 500,000.

            "content": "About the Knox Deployment App. The Knox Deployment App is a mobile application available from the Google Play Store that is uniquely designed to help streamline the enterprise deployment of Samsung phones and tablets running Knox 2.8 or higher. The Knox Deployment App enables customers to seamlessly enroll devices using Knox mobility solutions. About the Knox Deployment App The Knox Deployment App provides the flexible option to IT admins needing to bulk enroll end-user devices without having a reseller. Using this app allows IT Admins to reduce their bulk deployment time, by using a primary device without factory resetting each device. Once enrolled, an IT admin can easily locate the devices within the Knox solution console. The Knox Deployment App does not support the enrollment of Samsung devices without Knox. Look at this list of supported devices to check whether your device is supported or not. NFC enrollment With Near Field Communication (NFC) enrollments, a non-B2B device is \"bumped\" (held closely together) with another smartphone device with Knox Deployment App running and scanning in NFC mode. The dedicated primary NFC device displays profiles available for enrollment and end user device enrollment begins once an IT admin selects a profile. The NFC enrollment option is not available to tablet devices. For more information, go to: NFC deployment. NFC is not supported with Android 11 device deployments, and is not available on the device's swipe menu. Bluetooth enrollment To support Bluetooth-based enrollments, an IT admin can install the Samsung Knox Deployment App on a dedicated admin/primary smartphone or tablet device, and select existing profiles. If the user's device is within proximity of the primary device, the user device connects to the admin device wirelessly via Bluetooth without a PIN or password requirement. For more information, go to: Bluetooth deployment. Wi-Fi Direct enrollment Wi-Fi Direct supported devices can connect directly to each other through a WLAN, without joining a traditional wireless network or Wi-Fi hotspot. Once enabled, the device automatically scans for other supported Wi-Fi direct devices. Once discovered, specific devices can be selected for enrollment data transfer. For more information, go to: Wi-Fi Direct deployment. Using the Knox Deployment App does not apply the profile to the admin/primary device. It only broadcasts the profile to the devices in the vicinity. Additionally, only end-user devices within physical proximity of the admin/primary device with an active Knox Deployment App can enroll. The screens utilized within this guide are from a smartphone. If running the Knox Deployment App on a tablet, the information on the screen would be identical, just optimized to fit the tablet's display capabilities. #App version information Knox Deployment App version information and available open source licenses can be referenced from within the ABOUT screen. Samsung recommends you periodically compare the Knox Deployment App's version to the latest available from Samsung to ensure you have the latest feature set and functionality available. To launch the Knox Deployment App's ABOUT screen: 1. Refer to the listed version number and note the version. If needed, select Open source licenses to review the open source licenses available to your Knox deployment. Prerequisites 1. The IT admin must create a Samsung account and ensure: Your devices support the Bluetooth, NFC (Android 10 or below), or Wi-Fi Direct protocols. Check your device specification if unsure. You have at least one profile configured in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Get the appropriate licenses to enroll devices (through the Samsung Knox Portal for KC or KG). KME does not require a license. 3. Install the Knox Deployment App on an admin/primary device, and login using their Knox Portal ID/password. 4. Select a profile on the primary device to apply to the end-user devices. 5. Ensure that the device you are enrolling has not already been uploaded to a KCS service. KDA is only designed for use with one KCS service at a time. Devices already enrolled via KDA can then be reassigned or updated through the KCS console it was uploaded to. To avoid encountering issues with KDA enrollment, please ensure you remove your device from any KCS services it is in before using KDA to enroll in another. Find more information about it here. 6. Two-factor authentication will be mandatory for all IT admins using Knox Deployment Application. Refer to 2FA for more details. The Knox Deployment App does not support the enrollment of Samsung devices without Knox. Look at this list of supported devices to check whether your device is supported or not. Two-factor authentication To allow the Knox Deployment App (KDA) to leverage Samsung Account's security features (like login alert, trusted device management, force logout, account activity history, and so on) two-factor authentication (2FA) will be required when logging in to KDA. A user who does not have 2FA set up will be directed to configure 2FA first. A user who signs in to KDA effectively signs in with their Samsung Account on the entire device - not just KDA. In addition, the minimum Knox version for KDA is now Knox 2.8 (Android 7.1). The following are accepted as the second form of authentication: Phone number, Authenticator app (such as Microsoft Authenticator, Google OTP, and so on), Verification code sent to other Galaxy devices, Backup codes The following images show how an IT admin can login using 2FA with a phone number: The following are the user impacts: Once the user has successfully signed in, they no longer need to sign in again. Once the user has set up 2FA on their account, it will also be required when they sign in to Samsung Knox. Users using a personal Samsung Account for B2C services (for example, Samsung Health, SmartThings, and so on) will not be able to sign in to KDA on the same device with their enterprise account. They will need to sign out of their personal account first. For more information, see the FAQs for two-step verification. Using the Knox Deployment App This section describes the screen flow navigation for a typical enrollment using the Knox Deployment App. 1. Select SIGN IN once the Knox Deployment App launches on the device. If the Knox Deployment App is already running on the device, the initial screen does not display, and the application displays the sign in screen. Make sure to sign out of any Samsung account from the device if it is not the correct account for desired deployment or doesn't have Knox Deployment permission. If the account does not have Knox Deployment permission, the app will ask you to sign out of the current account and sign in to one with this permission. 2. Enter the Knox Portal Username and Password to sign in to the Knox Deployment App using 2FA. If you encounter difficulty signing in to the Knox Deployment App, ensure you have either a valid Knox Portal account with privileges for the Knox solution you are trying to enroll in. If that is not the issue, select Forgot your email or password? on Knox Portal login for assistance retrieving your login credentials. Once you have successfully signed in to the Knox Deployment App, a WELCOME screen displays providing first-time options for profile selection and deployment mode selection.

To enroll and deploy devices using the KDA Wi-Fi Direct option: 1. From the admin primary device, navigate to the SELECT DEPLOYMENT MODE screen and select Wi-Fi Direct as the device deployment mode. 2. Once Wi-Fi Direct is selected as the deployment mode, specify whether the Wi-Fi Direct connection is automatic or manual from the following two options: _Accept manually_ - Requires a device user to enter a system generated PIN every time a connection is requested from an enrolling device. This is the default setting, and provides greater security and data protection. _Accept automatically_ - Automatically accept connection requests from enrolling devices. Both of these Wi-Fi Direct connection options are described in the sections that follow. #Accept connection requests manually If wanting to establish a manual Wi-Fi Direct connection: A Wi-Fi Direct manual connection requires a PIN be entered correctly before the expiration of a timer. Ensure you correctly document the displayed PIN before pressing Connect to initiate the countdown timer. 1. Select Accept manually when prompted from the Select Wi-Fi Direct screen. 2. Document the displayed PIN needed to proceed with the manual Wi-Fi Direct connection. 3. Select Connect before the countdown expires to proceed. An Accept sharing request screen displays prompting for the required PIN before the countdown timer expires. 4. Type the required PIN and select Accept. This enables the listed primary/admin device to share enrollment information via the newly established Wi-Fi Direct connection. 5. Select FINISH DEPLOYMENT on primary/admin device to complete the enrollment date transfer. #Accept connection requests automatically If wanting to establish an automatic Wi-Fi Direct connection: 1. Select Accept automatically when prompted from the Select Wi-Fi Direct screen. 2. Select Connect before the countdown expires to initiate a Wi-Fi Direct connection with the primary/admin device. This enables the listed device to share enrollment information via the newly established Wi-Fi Direct connection. 3. Select FINISH DEPLOYMENT on primary/admin device to complete the enrollment date transfer.",

            "content": "Manage admins and roles. This topic describes how to invite and manage admins, as well as assign the required roles and permissions needed to complete an admin invitation. Knox Configure supports a _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to the KC service specifically, the Super Admin role cuts across all supported services. Existing customers will have their administrators migrated to the RBAC service automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. Knox Configure administrators can either be invited individually (Invite and manage admins) or in bulk (Bulk invite admins). Invite and manage admins Only selected IT admins are approved to enroll and manage devices on behalf of customers. Invite IT admins from within the Knox Configure portal as needed, and assign them unique enrollment and configuration services and permissions. 1. Select Administrators & Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the INVITE ADMINISTRATOR button from the top, right-hand side, of the screen. An Invite administrator screen could display stating that before an administrator can be invited a role must be first created and available for assignment. Ensure appropriate roles are created and available before proceeding with an administrator invitation. 3. Select the CREATE ROLE button. 4. If creating a role for a pending administrator invitation, provide the required Role name and an optional description. Refer to the Permissions portion of the screen and select additional permissions by category as required beyond the basic permissions assigned by default. When permissions require restriction to view only access for certain permission areas, consider selecting the View only option. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. The Invite and manage administrators permission (within the Administrators and Roles category) can only be granted by an existing administrator who themselves has that specific permission. Refer to the Allow access to Knox Deployment Application option, at the bottom of the screen, to enroll devices directly in Knox Configure using the KDA, and not the Knox Configure console. When relying exclusively on the KDA without the Knox Configure console, an admin must sign in to the KDA, choose a service (KC, KME, KG, etc.), select a profile, pair the primary/admin device with the target device, and assign the profile to the target device. Select SAVE to continue. 5. Provide the following to complete an administrator invitation: First Name - Provide the first name of the administrator resource for this invitation. Last Name - Provide the last name of the administrator resource for this invitation. Email - If this email is not already associated with a Samsung Account, the user will have to create a Samsung Account before logging in to Knox Configure. The creation of a Samsung account is required before an administrative account can be created. Samsung Knox does not support personal email addresses for new Knox account requests that have not been registered as a Samsung account. If the administrator's email is already associated with an active samsungknox.com account, the invitation will fail with an error. Contact Samsung Knox support for assistance resolving the error. Role - Use the drop-down menu to assign this new administrator a role that is appropriate to their intended administrative function. If unsure about the exact permissions of an available role, select View Role Details to review the scope of its available permissions. Samsung Knox does not support personal email addresses for new Knox account requests that have not been registered as a Samsung account. However, they can be invited as additional admins. 6. Select INVITE when completed. The newly added, but pending, administrator displays by name, with their name displaying as a link that can be selected to update the administrator name and company management designation. If editing the administrator's profile, select Save. Edit or delete a role Existing roles can be modified or deleted as their configurations warrant update or deletion from administrator assignment. To edit or delete an existing role: 1. Select Administrators & Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Ensure the ROLES tab is displayed. 3. Select a role whose configuration requires deletion and removal from Knox Configure. 4. Either edit the configuration of the existing role and select SAVE, or select the DELETE button at the bottom of the screen to permanently remove the role. Optionally revise the existing Role name and Description. When permissions require restriction to view only access for certain permission areas, consider selecting the View only option. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. If there are administrators currently using this role and screen displays stating the administrators assigned this role will receive updated permissions based on your role revisions. Select CONFIRM to proceed. When deleting a role with administrators already assigned, existing administrators assigned to a role intended for deletion must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. Any pending, revoked, or blocked admins assigned the deleted role are assigned a role of NoRole. Select the DELETE button to proceed with the role deletion. Bulk invite admins Administrators can be invited in bulk by uploading a properly formatted CSV file to the console. To bulk invite admins: 1. Select Administrators & Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the INVITE ADMINISTRATOR button from the top right-hand side of the screen. 3. Click Invite multiple administrators from the Invite administrators screen. 4. Browse to the location of a properly formatted CSV file containing the correct information for administrator uploads. If unsure how to format a CSV file for administrator uploads, select the Download CSV file template link. The template displays the following guidance for preparing the CSV file. Before uploading the CSV, please erase the explanation line beginning with #. The row: First name, Last name, Email address is the header row and cannot be deleted. Next row will contain information of admins that you want to invite. Each row below header need to have first name, last name and email, separated by a comma. First and last names cannot contain numeric characters. Email address should follow valid format as name@domain. Each field can have maximum 60 characters. 5. Use the Role drop-down menu to select the role to apply to each administrator in the CSV file. Once the administrators are uploaded to the console, their roles can be changed as required. 6. Select INVITE to initiate the administrator upload. The newly added, but pending, administrators display by name, with their names displaying as links that can be selected to update their administrator names and company management designations. When trying to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 special characters: = + @ ( ).

If you're setting up a new device or a device that's been factory reset, enrollment can be done automatically as part of the device setup procedures. Alternatively, if you're enrolling a device that's already in use, you can enroll it without factory resetting the device. #Enroll a factory reset device To reduce the labor required with large deployments, a device profile push can be completed by the end user pressing FINISH on their device, or after a 5 second auto-timer expiration. The device FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a 5 second timer to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input after the 5 second timer countdown, the device screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. 1. Turn on the device and go through the device setup procedures. 2. If you have not done so already, connect to a Wi-Fi network. Knox Configure prompts you to begin the device enrollment process. 3. Tap Continue. Read the EULA and tap Agree to enroll the device. 4. The following processes occur: The device downloads the Knox Configure profile. If apps are in the profile, the device downloads and installs those apps. Knox Configure activates a license. The device downloads other required content. 5. When the device is successfully enrolled, a confirmation screen displays. If the device has been configured as a ProKiosk, a device reboot is required. #Enroll a device that's already in use 1. Open the device's browser and go to configure.samsungknox.com. 2. If the device has never been set up with Knox Configure before, tap FIRST-TIME ENROLLMENT. If the device has previously been set up with Knox Configure, tap RE-ENROLL. Alternatively, the device user can request the updated profile data from their device. For devices running Android 13 or higher, you can pull a profile update using Device settings > Advanced features > Configuration service > Profile information > Update. For devices running older versions of Android, you can pull a profile update using Device settings > About phone > Software information > Knox Configure > Apply latest profile. #Enroll a device using a QR code You can set up QR code enrollment to allow device users to assign a profile to a device by scanning a QR code generated in the profile creation process. See the QR code enrollment section of Create a profile for details. Once enrolled with a QR code, the device user can't assign a different profile to the device using a QR code until the device has been unassigned. Once you've generated an enrollment QR code for a profile, device users can scan it during the out-of-box enrollment process to configure their device with the profile. Unassign a device When unassigning a device from a profile, be aware that an admin is unable to manage the device until after a profile is configured again. An admin is also unable to send push updates until a new profile assignment is made. A device can be unassigned from its assigned profile when: A customer manually unassigns the device from its profile. The device is using a staggered license and the service period has ended. The device is using a non-staggered license and the 30-day license expiration grace period has ended. Additionally, when a device is unassigned from its profile, the following occurs regardless of profile type: The Knox Configure server sends a push update to revoke policies. The Knox Configure client keeps apps and content. The Knox Configure client will not be uninstalled. A factory reset is allowed. Devices can be unassigned from the DEVICES screen when the selected device has a status of Profile assigned, Error, Canceled by user, Configured, Failed to configure, or Updates pushed.

            "content": "About Shared Device. The Knox Configure Shared Device feature enables multiple users to access the same device without sharing data across multiple devices, thus reducing the risk of an exploited device. When powering on a Shared Device, each employee is prompted to sign in a separate account with their Active Directory credentials and manage their own unique set of files and apps. Each user's settings, accounts, applications and policies are saved to their user account. After a user signs out, data is wiped from the device and isn't shared with other users. Shared device functionality is optional and not required when creating a Knox Configure profile. The Knox Configure client will ignore shared device configurations on devices running the Android Q version operating system and above. The Knox Configure console provides a warning for now unsupported status of shared device and E-billing on the Q version operating system. If the shared device feature was already enabled on an existing device, and that device was FOTA updated to the Q version operating system, the shared device feature should be disabled when a newly applied profile has shared device disabled. #Samsung Knox Single Sign On (SSO) Samsung's SSO technology is based on the Kerberos protocol, which allows device users to authenticate with a single account and access a wide range of enterprise resources efficiently without having to sign in to each application. SSO eliminates the burden of having to remember multiple passwords and affords users the luxury of a single password that meets corporate password policies. Once an employee is finished using the Shared Device, they simply sign out and hand the device to the next user, who then enters their own secure credentials to access their files and apps. To sign in to a Shared Device, users must maintain an active connection to their corporate Wi-Fi network or VPN. Shared device functionality does not work on devices utilizing a Knox container. Ensure device containers are removed prior to activating a Shared Device. The application client and Samsung's SSO solution on the device authenticate with Enterprise Active Directory as follows: SSO client on the device communicates with Active Directory for Kerberos authentication through VPN or by using on-premise Wi-Fi. Upon successful authentication, the SSO client provides the requested authentication token to the app. The authentication token, Negotiate token (for HTTP Negotiate) or SAML response (for SAML 2.0) is then forwarded to an Intranet service or cloud device respectively depending on the token request time. Prerequisites The following prerequisites are required to set up and use a Shared Device: 1. Active Directory , End user credentials , Kerberos (port 88) must be enabled for the Shared Device authentication 2. A supported Samsung device running Knox 2.6 or higher. Configure Shared Device In order to use a device as a Shared Device, you need to set up Shared Device settings for the device's profile. Shared Device is only supported in Dynamic edition Normal mode profiles. By default, users can factory reset their device after logging in to their Shared Device account. Once the device is factory reset, the Knox Shared Device APK is removed and the device can be used as a regular Android device with no restrictions. When factory reset, Wi-Fi, and mobile data is disabled in Knox Configure. Consequently, the device can't be updated or unenrolled. We recommend preventing users from factory resetting their device - for details, see the Security section of Configure profile settings. #For Knox 2.8 and lower 1. Select Enable Shared device. When you assign this profile to the device, the Shared Device agent will be uploaded to the device. 2. Optionally, choose a Background image for the Shared Device screen. 3. Optionally, upload an XML configuration file to set the Active Directory domain name and other optional fields. 4. Optionally, upload your Company logo and enter your Company name. You can view a preview of the Shared Device screen with your custom logo and name on the right. #For Knox 2.9 and higher Devices supporting Knox version 2.9 and higher support additional Shared Device configuration options. 1. Enable Shared device. When you assign this profile to the device, the Shared Device agent will be uploaded to the device. 2. Enter your corporate Active Directory domain name. When the device user powers on the device, they receive a prompt to sign in to the Shared Device with their Active Directory credentials for this domain. A successful login is required to access Shared Device resources. 3. Optionally, choose a Background image for the Shared Device screen. 4. Optionally, upload your Company logo and enter your Company name. You can view a preview of the Shared Device screen with your custom logo and name on the right. 5. Optionally, in Screen timeout (minutes), enter the maximum amount of time a Shared Device can remain idle before password credentials must be re-entered to resume access. If left empty, the default value is 120 minutes. 6. Optionally, in Maximum allowed screen lock attempts reached, enter the maximum number of failed lock screen attempts permitted on a Shared Device. If left empty, the default value is 5. 7. Optionally, enter the package names of any apps that you want to retain their data even after exiting Shared Device mode. You can upload a CSV of app package names if you want to add apps in bulk. 8. Select Enable Kerberos SSO to upload Samsung's recommended Kerberos authenticator to the Shared Device. #Prevent users from stopping the Knox Shared Device app By default, users can disable the Knox Shared Device app by navigating to Settings > Application Manager. After the app is disabled, the device converts to a regular Android device without restrictions beyond the policies that you have already deployed. Samsung recommends blocking the Force Stop and Clear Data options for the Knox Shared Device. Consider deploying policies to prevent users from going to Application Manager and using the Force Stop or Clear Data options to prevent a Shared Device app from running properly. If you programmatically manage a Knox Shared Device, call the APIs referenced below and pass com.sec.enterprise.knox.shareddevice and com.sec.enterprise.knox.shareddevice.keyguard as the packageList input parameter: `addPackagesToForceStopBlackList (List packageList)`, `addPackagesToClearDataBlackList (List packageList)`, `addPackagesToClearCacheBlackList (List packageList)`, `setApplicationUninstallationDisabled (List packageName)` Use the Knox Configure Shared Device Refer to the following information to set up and sign in to a Knox Shared Device, and if necessary uninstall Knox Shared Device. #Setup Knox Shared Device To configure Knox Shared Device support on the actual device: 1.

You can create device profiles in Knox Configure and then assign them to devices. Device assignments are not permanent, which means you can change the profile of any device that's currently in a Configured state with an update. Compatibility between profile types You can't update a device configured with a Setup profile. However, you can update a device configured with a Dynamic profile with either a Setup or a Dynamic profile. Profile conversion , Allowed - , - Setup to Dynamic , No Setup to Setup , No Dynamic to Setup , Yes Dynamic to Dynamic , Yes Allow the device user to install an update overnight When you update a device profile, the device user can schedule the update to be installed overnight unless you choose to force the update. The update notification sent to the device shows the total download size of the update to help the device user make an informed decision about when to apply it. If the device user schedules the update for overnight installation, the device attempts to apply the update between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM according to the current time zone. If the device is in use during that time, it attempts to apply the update the next night during the same period. If the device fails to apply the update overnight for four consecutive days, the device will attempt to apply the update when the device is turned on and a network connection is available the next day. Reassign a profile To assign a different profile to a device: 1. On the Knox Configure console, go to Profiles. 2. Select the profile you want to assign the device to. Note that a single profile can be assigned to different device models, while a selection of multiple profiles can only be assigned to one model. 3. Click ACTIONS, then click Assign devices. 4. On the Select devices screen, select one or more devices that you want to assign the profile to. You can only push a profile change to devices with a status of Configured. If you can't find the device you're looking for, you can search for it by its IMEI/MEID, serial number, or custom ID. For details, see Updates to device search from 23.09. 5. Click ASSIGN to proceed with the device profile update and review your changes on the Change assigned profile dialog. If the selected devices are currently assigned a different profile or a different version of the same profile, you're warned that the selected devices will be unassigned from their previous profiles and assigned to the selected profile.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles. This topic describes how to invite and manage admins, as well as assign the required roles and permissions needed to complete an admin invitation. Knox Configure now supports a new _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to the KC service specifically, the Super Admin role cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. Create a role To create a role: 1. Select Administrators and Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the ROLES tab. 3. From the ACTIONS drop-down menu, select Create role. 4. Provide the following role details: Role name - Enter unique name for the role to help you identify the newly created role during assignment. Description - Enter a description for the role. Max 200 characters permissible. Allow access to the Knox Configure portal - Admins with this role will be granted basic permissions. Note that additional permissions will need to be specified as needed. Profiles - Add View only or Manage profile permissions. Add the ability to Create and edit and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Devices and Uploads - Add View only or Manage devices permissions. Add the ability to Assign and push update, Unassign, Reboot/Factory reset, Manage tags and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Licenses - Add View only or Manage licenses permissions. Add the ability to Add and edit, and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Library - Add View only or Manage library permissions. Add the ability to Add,edit and download, and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Resellers - Add View only or Manage reseller permissions. Add the ability to Register and edit reseller, and approve uploads, and Delete to the role's manage permissions. Activity log - Add the permission to View activity log to the role. Administrative privileges - Specify the following role privileges: Invite and Manage administrators, and Manage roles. The ability to Create and manage roles is a highly critical permission. Admins with this permission can also add and edit roles to include any permissions in the list. Allow access to Knox Deployment Application - Admins with this permission can enroll devices in Knox Configure using the Knox Deployment Application. 5. Click Save. Edit or delete a role Existing roles can be modified or deleted as their configurations warrant update or deletion from administrator assignment. To edit or delete an existing role: 1. Select Administrators & Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Ensure the ROLES tab is displayed. 3. Select a role whose configuration requires deletion and removal from Knox Configure. 4. Either edit the configuration of the existing role and select SAVE, or select the DELETE button at the bottom of the screen to permanently remove the role. Optionally revise the existing Role name and Description. When permissions require restriction to view only access for certain permission areas, consider selecting the View only option. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. If there are administrators currently using this role and screen displays stating the administrators assigned this role will receive updated permissions based on your role revisions. Select CONFIRM to proceed. When deleting a role with administrators already assigned, existing administrators assigned to a role intended for deletion must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. Any pending, revoked, or blocked admins assigned the deleted role are assigned a role of NoRole. Select the DELETE button to proceed with the role deletion. Invite an admin If you haven't yet, ensure that you create a role prior to inviting an admin. Once you've created admin roles,\"IT admins can be invited from within the Knox Configure portal as needed and assigned roles with unique permissions. Note that there's a limitation to administrative roles and permissions: Only selected IT admins are approved to enroll and manage devices on behalf of customers. When inviting admins, a Managed role permission is required. Existing admins without a Managed role permission are limited to inviting admins to a role that matches their own set of role permissions. In the Invite administrator screen, the Role drop-down menu has been customized to correspond to the particular admin's role when creating the invitation. Knox Configure administrators can either be invited individually or in bulk: #Invite an admin 1. Select Administrators and Roles from the left-hand navigation menu. 2. Select the ADMINISTRATORS tab. 3. From the ACTIONS drop-down menu, select Invite administrator. 4. Provide the following to complete an administrator invitation: First Name - Provide the first name of the administrator resource for this invitation. Last Name - Provide the last name of the administrator resource for this invitation. Email - If this email is not already associated with a Samsung Account, the user will have to create a Samsung Account before logging in to Knox Configure. The creation of a Samsung account is required before an administrative account can be created. Role - Use the drop-down menu to assign this new administrator a role that is appropriate to their intended administrative function. If unsure about the exact permissions of an available role, select View Role Details to review the scope of its available permissions. Samsung Knox doesn't support personal email addresses for new Knox account requests that have not been registered as a Samsung account. However, they can be invited as additional admins. 5. Select INVITE when completed. The newly added, but pending, administrator displays by name, with their name displaying as a link that can be selected to update the administrator name and company management designation. If editing the administrator's profile, select Save. #Bulk invite administrators If necessary, administrators can be invited in bulk with just a single CSV file bulk upload operation. To bulk invite administrators: 1. Select Administrators and roles from the left-hand navigation menu. Ensure the ADMINISTRATORS tab is selected. 2. Select Bulk invite administrators from the ACTIONS drop-down menu. 3. Within the UPLOAD\"administrators list field, browse for a properly formatted CSV file containing the names of the admins you intend to invite. Optionally, Download CSV file template to utilize an existing Knox Configure template for easier creation and submission of the bulk administrator invitation. 4. Use the Select role drop-down menu to select a role that will be applied to all the administrators included within the CSV file. 5. Once the CSV file and role are defined, select the INVITE button to proceed with the bulk administrator invitation. The administrators within the CSV file are added to the ADMINISTRATORS tab with a pending status before they are promoted to an Active status or are Revoked or Blocked.",

When an IT administrator pushes an updated configuration, each device utilizing the updated profile receive the configuration update, whether intended or not. With this enhancement, an IT admin can selected individual devices for push updates from the portal's PROFILES tab or at the time of profile modification. This helps administrators update just those specific devices intended to receive a specific update and exclude those devices that do not need to receive the updates. This section will guide you through the Configuration tab when creating a profile. For information on updating and replacing an existing wearable device profile, go to: Updating an existing device profile Displays The Displays tab allows you to select a custom watch face, set custom booting and shutdown animations when creating a profile.

Background push updates now permitted This enhancement enables an IT admin or system integrator to push an updated profile or application to Samsung Gear wearable devices without any related UI displaying on the target device. This enables the wearable device user to continue to use their device without interruption, as profile or application updates occur in the background. Frictionless Customization Currently, when an error occurs during wearable device enrollment, the enrollment process stops, regardless of the error type, and a failure is reported to KC server. Additionally, the current messaging is inadequate to properly define the scope and severity of the problem that halted enrollment. Watch face alteration and deletion prevention This feature addresses requests by IT admins who need a dynamic profile restriction policy option that prevents wearable device users from changing their device's watch face, once it is configured and set on the device. Disallow application uninstall This feature enables an IT admin to configure a list of applications that cannot be uninstalled by the device user post enrollment and deployment. Removing an application from the disallow uninstall app list removes the uninstall restriction, and provides the device user the capability to remove the application from their device. If utilizing a setup edition profile, just a single application is permitted in the uninstall prevention list. Dynamic profile updates and management This enhancement enables an IT admin to assign a new profile to devices already having an assigned profile. If a device is configured with an old profile, a push notification for a profile update is delivered and the device can updated with a new profile. The device's status updates to \"Update pushed\" and then moves to \"Configured\" once the updated configuration is applied to the device. The transition from the old profile to the new profile is seamless. If the new profile has different profile information (company, email, and phone number etc.), it should be processed on the target device without disruption. Additionally, if the old profile is utilizing a ProKiosk mode setting, the device exits ProKiosk mode and is re-configured based on the settings of the new profile. Application deployment improvements To date, if an application does not support a Gear S3LTE (R765) model wearable device, the wearable Knox Configure back-end returns an invalid package error. To broaden the list of supported wearable devices the Gear S3 BT or Gear Sports are now also included, so an IT admin can add a wearable application for those devices as well. New profile push policies supported To date, if a wearable device's assigned profile is changed, a profile push update occurs regardless of the profile's edition. New rules are now in place to restrict setup edition profiles from receiving a push update. A dynamic profile can still push update another dynamic edition profile, and a setup edition profile can push update a dynamic edition profile. However, a setup edition profile can no longer update another setup edition profile, nor can a dynamic edition profile push update a setup edition profile. Back to release notes",

Companion mode support added IT admins can now maintain profile configurations assigned to wearable devices using Knox Configure, while device users can switch between without phone connection (WPC) mode and companion mode. Additionally, a profile can be configured on the wearable device while connected to the phone. This feature maintains the device configuration during a mode change, and the companion mode configuration, so device users can use their configured wearable device with the phone connection. APN setting updates for WKC Setup edition profiles To date, support for access point network (APN) settings have only been supported in Knox Configure Dynamic edition profiles for wearable devices. With this release, the same APN settings available for Dynamic edition profiles are now available for Setup edition profiles as well. August 29th 2018 WKC feature updates #WKC + custom app configuration capability To date, when the ProKiosk mode is set using a custom app, a failure occurs during KC configuration. However, if previously applied profile and a new profile do not have a ProKiosk mode setting, KC does not have to show a failure for the ProKiosk mode set by the other app. #Optionally prevent device user from making settings menu or status bar changes With this release, IT admins can now create a dynamic edition profile and select an option to prevent a device user from accessing the Settings menu. The Knox Configure console displays that this feature is only available on Tizen 4.0 and above devices, and the device must be in standalone mode. WKC enrollment via the Knox Deployment App To date, WKC enrollment is conducted only during the initial out-of-box network search. An end user needed a factory reset to begin enrollment when the device is already in use.

Role-based access control improvements This release introduces a new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to the KC service specifically, the Super Admin role cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available.

Once the feature is selected, admins can create a Setup edition profile and assign devices before activating a Setup edition license. Once each device is activated, each license expiration date will depend on the device's activation date. This feature addresses customer concerns to only activate a Setup edition license once each device is actually activated. This enables customers to utilize licenses more efficiently, since a customer may not initially use Knox Configure after it is purchased, or deploy devices at the same time. Note that feature availability will vary per country. Existing KC SKUs will be kept as is, and are not immediately impacted by this change. Official notice will be shared with KC console users via email and console notifications two weeks prior to this release. \"Per Seat\" license for Dynamic edition profiles New to Knox Configure is the ability to revoke a license on one device for reallocation to another device. This new feature improves license provisioning efficiency with the Dynamic edition profile by utilizing the revoked licenses to increase the available license count. Note that feature availability will vary per country. Existing KC SKUs will be kept as is, and are not immediately impacted by this change. Official notice will be shared with KC console users via email and console notifications two weeks prior to this release. Assign multiple licenses to a profile To date, creating a profile required an assigned license. With this release, profile creation and license assignment are no longer linked. Each device will now follow the behaviour of their individually assigned license type. This new feature allows legacy licenses and new licenses to be used concurrently in the same profile, or if necessary, a profile can be created and saved without assigning a license. Knox Deployment App (KDA) license enhancement With this release, admins who are using KDA to enroll devices now have the option of explicitly assigning a license for KDA at profile creation. Note that licenses previously utilized with legacy profiles created prior to this release will be automatically migrated to KDA licenses. Only one license can be assigned for KDA. If the license is consumed or expires, the license will need to be replaced. KDA only access permission This feature allows admins to specify the use of only KDA for Bluetooth enrolments, without accessing the Knox Configure console. To do this, admins are required to log into KDA to choose a Knox Configure Cloud service, select a profile, pair the admin device to the target device, and assign the profile to the target device. Additionally, admins can give permission to allow access to KDA to enroll into Knox Configure directly using KDA. Admins now capable of being invited to multiple services An enhancement to Knox Configure now includes the ability to specify Administrative privileges.To date, admins were unable to invite admins from a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or Admin with a Manage role privilege can now invite another admin from a different service to a role in their service. For example, an admin for KC can invite another admin from KME. Note that existing admins without a Manage role permission are restricted to only inviting admins with a matching set of their own role permission. For example, a non-super admin won't be able to invite a Super admin from another service if they don't currently have Super admin permissions. Back to release notes",

View only admin permission added This enhancement to role-based access includes the option to create roles with View only permissions for Profiles, Devices and Uploads, Licenses, Library, and Resellers. When selecting the View only radio button, note that options under the manage permissions radio button will be disabled. Alternatively, when applying manage permissions, at least one manage permission option must then be selected. Existing roles that inherit the new View only permission will have the option off by default to prevent conflict issues, while new roles will have the View only permission selected by default. Italian console translation available In response to Italian customer requests, customers and subsidiaries in that country have requested an update to the Italian text with their own regional translations. Impacted areas within the console include: Dashboard, Devices > Devices, Licenses, Licenses > Activated Seats description, Feedback & Support > Resources, Profiles > Create a profile > Select edition, Profile editing > Application and content, Profile editing > Sound & display, Library > media > Actions > Add media > Create animation Improvements to error messaging This release includes improvements to both the portal UI and corresponding error code definitions. Error messages have been updated to provide additional information specific to the event in order to assist admins in troubleshooting and in making informed decisions. Profile deletion improvements To date, when a profile is selected from within the console's Profiles tab, the Delete profiles option is disabled from the Actions drop-down menu, even though the profile isn't assigned to a device. The user, not knowing the reason this option is disabled, is understandably confused. To remedy this situation, the user must consent to the deletion within a pop-up message. However, if there any default profiles selected for deletion, a message displays stating they cannot be deleted since they have already been uploaded by the listed reseller. Profile licensing enhancements An enhancement to profile licensing has been included in this release to enable admins to enter license keys before assigning the license to a profile. This feature allows admins to enter a license key which will then be added to the license drop-down menu. For more information, go to License Management. Disable power saving mode for Kiosk mode With this release, IT admins now have the option of disabling Power Saving mode for Kiosk mode profiles. This new feature disables user access to Power Saving mode to enhance work flow productivity for devices with ProKiosk mode profiles. In addition, this feature blocks pop ups and prompts related to Power Saving mode. Back to release notes",

App version display enhancements Included in this release are enhancements to the Application Details screen, which improves on how apps display their version information. Prior to this release, apps were displayed on the app list without their current version information, which can make it difficult to identify latest versions for potential device updates. For additional details, go to app management. With this enhancement, apps are now listed separately with the following details: Version - Displays version number of the app. Name - Displays the Application Name assigned when uploading the app to Knox Configure. Description - Displays the Description entered when uploading the app to Knox Configure. Used in profiles - Displays profiles the app is assigned to. Size - Displays the TPK or WGT file size for the wearable app. Modified - Displays the timestamp the app was last modified. Revoke WKC policies manually before a device is assigned a different profile When a WKC profile configuration changes from profile A to B, the profile revokes its previously defined policies from profile A, then applies its new policies from the profile B. For example, in Setup to Dynamic, Dynamic to Setup, Setup to Setup, and Dynamic to Dynamic profile changes. Note that if a Per Seat license is being used, a push command is sent out once the device is unassigned from its previous profile. Knox Custom policies now revoked once WKC is uninstalled This feature ensures Knox Custom policies are revoked once WKC is uninstalled by adding the Knox Custom policy revocation logic before `mdm_uninstall_application()` is called. Activity log updates for admin events With this release are enhancements to the Activity log to provide a broader range of admin event changes for easier debugging. These admin events include: Admin invitations, Admin modifications, Resent, reactivated or revoked invitations, Deactivated or reactivated accounts Activity log name clarification To date, when an event was administrated by a Samsung Admin, both the names: Samsung Administrator and Samsung Knox Team were displayed within the activity log. This inconsistency raised the question whether there are two different admin types. To improve consistency, all activity log events administrated by a Samsung admin will display the name Samsung Knox Team. Warning message improvements when for profile unassignment Starting this release, a warning message will appear to notify admins that unassigning a profile from a device would result in no longer being able to control the device or push a profile update. KC supported country added under SEWA subsidiary : Nigeria Nigeria has been added to the list of supported countries for KC. Nigeria will be listed under the West Africa (SEWA) subsidiary. To review the update, view the list of supported countries for Knox Configure. UI improvements on the KC Dashboard To improve the UI of the KC Dashboard, the displayed profile name and \"X\" close icon are now center-aligned within the profile widget to provide a uniform display.

Booting animation enhancements Currently, when deselecting the Set a custom booting animation option on a profile, the existing booting animation and sound are not cleared as expected from the wearable device when an update is pushed to the device. The same expectation should occur when deselecting the Set a custom shutdown animation option on a profile: The shutdown animation and sound should be cleared when an update is pushed to the device. To date, WKC checks if an existing animation was set by a previous WKC profile, and will not remove the animation if it was set for a previous profile. To remedy this, users now have the ability to remove booting or shutdown animation separately when pushing an update. Enrollment improvements To date, when a profile is assigned and a wearable device has 15% power or less remaining, enrollment stops during the authentication stage after accepting the End User License Agreement (EULA). Once the wearable device is charged and rebooted, the device is expected to resume enrollment. However, enrollment doesn't resume if Power Saving mode is enabled, even if it was disabled just before license activation. To prevent enrollment disruptions, Power Saving mode is now automatically disabled at the start of enrollment and enabled again after license activation. Auto select newly uploaded apps To date, in order to deploy an app that's been recently uploaded into a profile, you would need to select the app manually from the app list after it's been uploaded. As part of this release, newly uploaded apps are now auto selected to enhance the app deployment work flow. Dashboard widget UI enhancements As part of a UI enhancement in this release, when an account has no profiles, the dashboard displays a Create profile button instead of the profile widgets. Selecting it starts the profile creation screen flow. If there are profiles in the account, a Select profile to pin here button is displayed. Selecting enables the user to pin profiles for quick access from the dashboard. Enhanced console string responses Included in this release are updates to the console response strings, which include error and success messages. Updated strings have been enhanced to include meaningful messages to assist with troubleshooting. For example, if an event has an error log entry associated with it, the log will include a link with additional information. Unable to select KDA licenses before activation date Currently, during profile creation, you won't be able to select the Knox Deployment App (KDA) license key is entered if the date of entry is before the set activation date. As part of an update in this release, the license drop-down menu will now include applicable licenses: Both active with remaining seats, as well as licenses that have yet to start. If a user tries to use KDA to enroll a device with a license prior to the activation date, a license error code is displayed for the device user. Back to release notes",

EAP for wearable devices Prior to this release, customers were unable to deploy wearable devices in areas where enterprise Wi-Fi was required for internal communication. Customers have requested to connect to a staging profile, deploy a profile, exit Kiosk mode on the wearable, authenticate into an Enterprise Wi-Fi (EAP-PEAP), pull-down a certificate, then re-deploy a Kiosk supported profile. However, this is not practical for deployments supporting thousands of wearable devices. With this release, admins can now create a profile and set its Advanced Wi-Fi setting's security type to 802.1x EAP (using either PEAP or TTLs). Admins can assign this profile to target devices to configure the deployment area's access point (AP) resource with 802.1x EAP as a hidden state to enable Wi-Fi connectivity for configured devices. This feature provides the ability to simultaneously provision a large number of EAP Wi-Fi supported wearable devices in for time and cost savings. The following Advanced Wi-Fi setting security type is not yet supported in this release: TTLS + NONE, and TTLS + GTC Download profile summary as a PDF With this release, an authenticated user can now download profile summary settings as a PDF to easily review settings and to conveniently use the output to create profiles in other accounts. The PDF output closely resembles the KC profile summary page that displays once a profile is configured and saved. To generate a PDF output of the profile summary: 1. Click Profiles from the left-hand navigation. 2. Click the profile link of the target device. 3. Once in the Profile configuration dashboard, click DOWNLOAD PROFILE SUMMARY AS A PDF. Note that the PDF won't exceed 5 MB and will have a UTC timestamp included once it's downloaded. Reassign devices to current license after renewal To date, when a Knox Configure license expires, a profile is unassigned from its assigned device. However, customers often want to renew their existing license used by deployed devices, but when the license is renewed, customers are unable to re-assign their devices. Additionally, when an unassigned device is assigned a profile using a renewed license, the devices are consuming new seats even though they have activated the license before. As part of this release, devices will no longer consume new license seats when re-assigned to profiles under the same license. However, devices will need to be manually re-assigned the license within the KC console. This feature enables customers to re-assign their unassigned devices to a provile and reuse the renewed license without consuming additional license seats for cost savings and efficiency.

Otherwise, these administrators will have No Role assigned once the deletion is complete. WKC version number addition In previous releases, users were unable to determine which version of WKC is running on their wearable device without looking at device logs.

Support Additional Hidden Network and Internet Proxy DNS Addresses Wi-Fi Options A hidden network doesn't display on the device Wi-Fi manager, and a manual connection isn't possible. It's often easier to provision the devices with KC instead of sharing the SSID/PSWD with each employee using a wearable. While Knox Configure can push Wi-Fi profiles, there is no hidden profile option or proxy address input unless it is an IP Address. With this release, support has been added within the Device connectivity screen for additional Wi-Fi options, including hidden network SSID and Internet proxy DNS addresses. For more information on configuring wearable Knox Configure profiles, go to: Setup edition or Dynamic edition. Support Additional Wi-Fi Options (Wi-Fi Always ON) This feature enables Knox Configure supported wearables deployed in factories, and other large areas, to remain connected to their preferred corporate Wi-Fi network so urgent updates pushed by IT are received on time. With this release, an option has been added within the Device connectivity screen to Keep WiFi always on. When selected Wi-Fi remains continuously on, even when the battery is low. Keep in mind, enabling this setting prevents Wi-Fi from being turned off under any circumstances. Power saving mode and Airplane mode are disabled when this option is selected, and once set, users are unable to change the Wi-Fi on and off settings. This option is available to both Setup and Dynamic edition wearable profiles. For more information on configuring wearable Knox Configure profiles, go to: Setup edition or Dynamic edition. Offline deactivation This feature addresses KC wearable admin requests to factory reset a wearable device after temporary usage or when no longer needed. This request becomes problematic when the Bluetooth connection between the paired phone and the wearable is broken, and there is no way for WKC to send a wipe and reset command and factory reset the wearable via the recovery mode. To address this issue, the WKC agent on the wearable will be invoked to perform a factory reset manually, even if there is no current Bluetooth connectivity. Back to release notes",

KC agent self-update capability The KC agent now has the following self-update capabilities if a newer KC agent is detected: If a device receives a push notification for a profile update, the KC agent self-checks for a new agent. If a newer agent is detected, the KC agent updates on the device and the KC agent configures the device with an updated profile. If an end user tries to apply the latest profile, the KC agent auto-checks whether there is a newer version of the agent. If there is a newer version, the KC agent auto updates. If a failure occurs, an agent update can be manually or automatically re-attempted until completed. Once completed, the KC agent configures the device with an updated profile. ELM license activation for KC installed apps KC now has the ability to activate an ELM license for those applications installed using KC. Additional enterprise applications installed using KC no longer need ELM license activation.

            "content": "Knox Configure 1.5 release notes. A new version of Knox Configure is launching with DS 1.5 specifically designed for Samsung Gear Sport wearable devices. KC for wearables utilizes the Setup and Dynamic editions available with traditional Knox Configure, as well as numerous KC features unique to wearable devices and watch face applications. KC for wearables should be attractive to B2B customers who would like to adopt smart solutions to enhance performance, beyond the existing Knox Tizen SDK for Gear devices. Widget customization on home screen To date, customers have requested re-sizable and customizable widgets on their device home screen. With the DS 1.5 release, widgets can be customized, enabling IT admins to upload a widget to the KC server and select the uploaded widget. Once added, a widget can be custom sized on the home screen. This process uses a KC portal simulator to optimally represent the actual user experience. Widget customization in only supported on Knox version 2.8 or above, regardless of whether you are presented with an option on using this feature with Knox version 2.7.1. Added customer feedback mechanism into KC portal To better understand the needs of Samsung's KC users, a Feedback page is now included within the portal allowing users to convey direct feedback, by subject and description, to a dedicated KC email distribution. The user can optionally contact Samsung Knox Support directly from the Feedback page if their feedback issue requires Support escalation. Lastly, users can permit Samsung contact them directly for further dialogue regarding their feedback. Reseller Portal #Internal references added for more robust customer searches Resellers have requested internal references be added as additional customer information for more robust search capability. With the DS 1.5 release, an internal reference (when made available) displays next to the customer name within the Customers screen. An IT admin can enter the internal reference within the Reseller Portal search field to search for a reseller. When exporting customer data to CSV, the generated CSV file contains a Company name/Internal reference column just like the Customers screen. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Configure 1.6 release notes. Admins can now assign a profile to a previously configured device and update the device's profile via a push notification. As a result, IT admins can now switch between different profiles with ease, whereas previously a device had to enroll again via a factory reset, URL, or Get Latest Profile button. Push updates available without pressing FINISH or RESTART A device profile push can be completed by the user pushing Finish or after a 5-second timer expiration. Beginning with this release, the FINISH and RESTART buttons still display, but there is a new 5-second timer under them to complete the action with less user input. If there is no user input after the 5-second countdown, the screen automatically moves to the device home screen or restarts. This feature reduces the labor required with large deployment profile pushes, where the FINISH or RESTART button must be selected on each device. Device auto-power off on power disconnect With the implementation of this enhancement, a new checkbox option is added into the Device Settings portion of the profile creation UX enabling admins to set device auto power off capability when a device is disconnected from its power source, regardless of the Knox version the device is utilizing. This enhancement is available for both setup and dynamic edition profiles. The existing Power on device when connected to a power source option works separately from the new profile power off option described here. Device lock/unlock for anti-fraud This feature enables carriers and resellers to lock down devices (if, for instance, a subscriber is delinquent in payment). If locked by Knox Configure, device status updates to Locked, and most device functions are locked. When a device locks, contact information (company name, phone number and Email) display within the lockscreen, but are editable by the admin. When unlocked by Knox Configure, the device status updates to Configured. Devices can be unlocked in two ways: An IT admin can unlock a device in the KC console, The user can input a provided password Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #3G feature support added for WKC profiles Beginning with this release, mobile data and data roaming can be set during WKC setup and dynamic profile creation for 3G devices. Dynamic edition profiles can have mobile data and roaming settings disabled and users can be prevented from changing mobile data and roaming settings as well. #APN support available for wearables (dynamic edition only) Beginning with this release, APN support is available for dynamic and Kiosk mode WKC profiles. APN support provides a gateway between a carrier providing 2G, 3G, or 4G mobile network service and the wearable device. When configuring a WKC profile, an admin can define a new APN configuration, set a preferred APN resource, and edit or remove an existing APN configuration. #WiFi proxy settings manageable on wearables IT admins and system integrators have requested improved management of Wi-Fi proxy device settings. In response, additional proxy settings have been added to the Default and Advanced Wi-Fi settings configurable within the profile Device Connectivity page. Additionally, the proxy address can now be entered in either IPv4 or IPv6 formats. #IT admins can now reset hardware key functions on wearables To date, KC does not have an option to clear hardware key function settings. With DS 1.6, UX options are now available to wearable device clear back key and home key mappings within the Displays configuration of device profiles. Back to release notes",

Knox Configure now supports Note 8 Enterprise Edition devices in Germany and the USA. To date, only S8 has been supported. This new Note 8 support is retroactive to the DS 1.6 release. Widget customization enhancements To best display widgets on a device's home screen, widget related information is now extractable from the APK for \"in-house\" apps (non Google Play store apps). Extracted widget properties include minHeight, minWidth, minResizeWidth, minResizeHeight, and resizeMode. When uploading in-house apps, a preview image extracts and displays. Enrollment enhancements This enhancement addresses our IT admins' request to have the device end user complete KC enrollment without touching the device's \"FINISH\" or \"RESTART\" button. To satisfy this request, the device's FINISH button remains as it is today, but a new 5-second timer displays under it. If there is no input from user for 5 seconds, the device automatically moves to its home screen. In ProKiosk mode, a message will display stating the device will restart in 5 seconds, then reboot automatically. New client side anti-fraud enhancement This enhancement enables a device user to make a call to the phone number displayed in the device's lock screen when they touch the number. Additionally, the device user can now send an email to an email address displayed in the lock screen when they touch the email address within the lock screen. New restrictions available in ProKiosk mode to restrict specific URLs on device This enhancement supports system integrators and IT admins who want to allow specific URLs in ProKiosk mode, and restrict specific URLs on an end user's device. URLs must be start with http://, https://, or ftp:// to be allowed or blocked successfully using an application URL restriction. The Applications field is mandatory for ProKiosk and normal mode profile support. Locked device stats now display in Knox Configure's Dashboard and Profile screens To optimally report and display the number of locked devices in the Knox Configure portal, new column items and color codes are available within the portal's Dashboard and Customization trend graph to visually report, trend and distinguish when devices are locked. New Knox Deployment App (KDA) with Bluetooth enrollment support To support Bluetooth enrollment, an IT admin can install the KDA on a dedicated admin (primary) device and select configuration profiles. A device user triggers Bluetooth enrollment by booting or factory resetting the device. If the user's device is within proximity of the admin's device, the user device connects to the admin device wirelessly via Bluetooth without a PIN or password requirement. The user enrolls using the profiles defined on the admin device. For more information, refer to the Knox Developers APP (KDA) User Guide. With the new KDA in the Play Store, IT admins will no longer be able to add user credentials for automated sign-up to EMMs. To locate the KDA within the Play Store, search for _Knox Deployment_. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #New APN configuration enhancements available With this APN enhancement, IT admins can now set a wearable's APN configuration Name, APN protocol (IPv4, IPv6) and MMSC. Once the APN configuration is added and applied, these variables display in the APN list. #IT admins can save content to a dedicated folder on wearable devices This enhancement permits system integrators and IT admins to save content on their end users' wearable device within a dedicated Contents folder. With this feature, an IT admin creates a dynamic or setup edition profile and selects files to save within the folder from the Knox Configure portal. The IT admin then associates devices with the profile. The IT admin then verifies the target files are saved within the wearable's Contents folder. #Factory resets available on wearables The existing factory reset option in the KC portal's Actions menu is now available to KC enrolled wearable devices using a dynamic edition profile. This allows wearable devices, when need be, to be factory reset and enrolled again. Back to release notes",

Assign preloaded application as home activity This feature enables an IT admin to define a preloaded application, including Samsung Browser, as a device kiosk mode home activity. ProKiosk mode requires the home activity support and run only one application. From the Home & Lock screen's Home activity drop down menu, select the + Add a pre-installed application option. The resulting pop-up allows a user to enter a valid package name in the input field. Once submitted, the provided application is available for selection within the Home activity drop-down menu. KLM license addition permitted prior to SLM activation date To date, only active KLM keys could be added within the Knox Configure console. Consequently, inactive KLM keys could not be added and registered to a KC server before their activation date. To satisfy both internal and external customer requests, an IT admin can now add a new KLM license (but not an inactive license) before its actual SLM activation date, enabling the admin to optimally register the license and assign a profile and devices before the license's activation date. A pop-up warning message displays stating the activation date for the license key has not yet started. Enhanced keyboard settings in ProKiosk mode With this enhancement, an IT admin can customize a ProKisok device's keyboard settings by turning On/Off predictive mode or enabling/disabling keyboard settings. The Predictive mode setting and Keyboard settings options function independent from one another, so there are no constraints on using these options together. Related API options are available within the Knox Customization SDK. Emergency call button available To date, when a device lock is applied, there was no option but to make a call to the number predefined by an IT admin. This posed a significant problem for users in an emergency, since they may not be able to reach out to the appropriate emergency responder. The new EMERGENCY CALL button provides a means of contacting a default emergency resource when the device PIN cannot be provided and the device unlocked. The contact used for the emergency call must be added within Contacts > ICE > emergency contacts > EDIT. KC console enhancements The following Knox Configure portal enhancements are included in DS 1.8: Within the portal's Device connectivity profile setting, the Hide notifications when open networks are detected checkbox option is removed in Knox versions 2.9 and above, as setWifiNetworkNotificationState is deprecated in the Knox 2.9 cSDK. A tooltip is available within the Enterprise Billing UX to inform an admin that only a single APN resource is available at a one time. The portal's Enable SIM lock feature has a new tooltip and User Guide update to reduce confusion: \"Enabling this feature will prevent the use of a corporate SIM card on any other device. Whenever the corporate device is powered on, it automatically unlocks the SIM card for that session. However, if the SIM card is moved to another device, it remains locked. The IT administrator can set a PIN here to unlock the SIM card for use on a different device.\" , The portal's Profiles table and its supporting column titles have become too crowded in some locations and languages. To remedy, column titles are shorter in some Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.). Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #KME feedback form enhancements The KME portal's feedback form is improved to better emphasize its intention as a general product feedback forum, and not a mechanism to submit bugs and issues. Additionally, a link has been added to submit KME portal bugs and issues directly to the Knox Support team. #DO profile enhancements Only a single APK is supported. For existing DO profiles, you need to remove all but a single APK to save the KME profile. #EULA, Terms of Service and User Agreement enhancements The following enhancements are available: Changed \"Knox-related EULAs\" to \"Knox-related agreements\", To date, the \"Enterprise License\" and \"Knox License\" links have both referred to the same Privacy Notice. To avoid confusion, both been replaced with the correct link name, \"Samsung Knox Privacy Notice\". The \"Knox Workspace\" link has been renamed \"Knox Workspace Terms and Condition\". #Additional country support Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Taiwan have been added to the list of countries and regions supporting KME. #Additional DO EMM support ManageEngine has been added to Samsung's list of EMMs supporting Google device owner (DO). DO is a privilege assigned to a EMM to apply policies and restrictions to a device during setup. Reseller Portal #Reseller portal UX updates With the DS 1.8 Reseller Portal release, the CUSTOMERS > Uploads screen has new columns for total uploaded devices and total number of registered valid devices. The number of Registered devices displays as a link that be selected to review registered device information in detail. Additionally, the CUSTOMERS > Devices tab no longer displays failed devices, as non-active device information is no longer sent to the portal interface. #Device verification improvements Rejected devices no longer display within the Reseller Portal's device table.

            "content": "Knox Configure 1.9 release notes. Improvements for adding shortcuts and widgets from home screen To date, the Home screen index started from 0 in Galaxy S8 and later model devices. With other models, if the zero page is disabled, the home screen starts from 0. However, if the zero page is enabled, the home screen starts from 1. To remedy this situation, the home screen index is adjusted for better consistency for both shortcuts and widgets, regardless of the presence of a Zeropage. Secondary admin permission enhancements To date, device deletions and profile un-assignments have had a significant impact to device management. Consequently, primary admins should be able to restrict secondary admin capability. With this enhancement, a primary admin can manage a secondary admin's permissions for device deletions and profile un-assignments at any time from the \"Manage Administrators\" page. To avoid impacts to existing customers, these two permissions are enabled by default. The menu options are greyed out if a secondary admin does not have adequate permissions for device deletions or profile un-assignments. Enable Bluetooth discoverable mode within Knox Configure console Currently, there is no on/off setting in the Knox Configure portal for Bluetooth discoverable mode, only a means to either enable or disable Bluetooth. Discoverable mode is a Bluetooth device state that enables Bluetooth devices to search, connect and transfer data amongst other Discoverable mode enables Bluetooth devices. The addition of Bluetooth discoverable mode with this release is just for Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles in either Normal or Kiosk mode. If an IT admin disables Bluetooth discoverable mode, the discoverable mode remains off even if the device end user enables Bluetooth on their device. If an IT admin wants to turn on Bluetooth discoverable mode on an end user's device, they uncheck the Disable Bluetooth discoverable mode option in Knox Configure. Once enabled in Knox Configure, discoverable mode remains on, even if the end user turns off Bluetooth on their device. Dynamic EE profile distinction To date, there is no parameter to differentiate Enterprise Edition profiles within the Knox Deployment App. To resolve this confusion, the Knox Deployment App now correctly lists Setup, Dynamic or Dynamic EE as the profile type to better categorize profile types. Feedback page optimizations Currently, the Knox Configure Feedback form is frequently used by customers to report technical issues with the portal, as opposed to a form for general feedback to improve their Knox Configure portal experience. To resolve this issue, links have been added into the Feedback form to route customers to the proper Support resources for filing a ticket. This update keeps the feedback form dedicated to portal improvements and not a resource for filing and escalating individual customer support issues.

Push updates now available for selected devices To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration profile, each device utilizing this specific profile receives the configuration update, whether intended or not. With this enhancement, an IT admin can select individual devices for push updates from the portal's PROFILES tab or at the\"time of profile modification. This helps admins update just those specific devices intended for an update, and exclude those devices that are not. Added support for activity name when adding shortcuts To date, KC permits only the package name for an application shortcut, but some apps, like contacts, include several activities and appear as independent apps to device users. With this release, support is now available for providing an activity name when creating a shortcut. The KC agent will fail however if the shortcut is provided as just an activity name, since the client validates the entire package name string (for example, `com.samsung.android.contacts/com.android.dialer.DialtactsActivity`). As an interim solution, the KC agent checks if an activity name exists before passing it as package. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Profile assignment enhancements To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration, each device utilizing the updated profile receive the configuration update, whether intended or not.

Now, the cancel profile setting is respected even though the device has been factory reset. Reseller Portal #Bulk device deletions now capped at 1,000 per single delete operation To date, the Reseller Portal permits bulk device deletions up to 10,000 at a time.

Bulk configuration operations include assigning and un-assigning profiles, device deletions, locking devices, unlocking devices, and adding tags. To bulk configure devices, navigate to DEVICES and select BULK ACTIONS. Follow the directions on the right-hand side of the screen for preparing a CSV file with one device ID per row then add the CSV file into the portal. Profile un-assignment change for locked or ProKiosk mode devices In response to requests from both our internal and external user communities, this enhancement enables a Locked or ProKiosk mode device to remain in its current locked state or kiosk mode, even after the device profile is unassigned. To date, when a profile is unassigned from a locked or kiosk mode device, the locked state or Kiosk mode is released. Removed model dependency from profile The Model field has been removed from profiles. Therefore, one profile can be assigned to different models types and users do not have to create a separate profile for each model. This also enables future profile enhancements such as \"auto-profile-assignment\". Push updates available for selected devices in DEVICES tab To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration profile, all devices or selected devices assigned to that profile can receive the configuration update. With this enhancement, an IT admin can select individual devices for push updates from the portal's DEVICES tab. This helps admins update just those specific devices intended for an update, and exclude those devices that are not. Guaranteed push update delivery To date, KC has not been able to guarantee the delivery of a push notification to devices. Additionally, if a device does not receive push notification message for a few weeks, for reasons such as a power-off, or no network availability, it is discarded. To remedy this issue, additional logic has been added to resend a push notification when an \"Updates pushed\" status has not been changed for an extended time. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Push updates available for selected wearable devices To date, when an IT admin pushes an updated configuration profile, each wearable device utilizing this specific profile receives the configuration update, whether intended or not.

The KME Terms & Conditions has been updated to remove portions of the Privacy Policy relating to the consent to use data. #Email address no longer required for support resource during enrollment An email address is no longer required as a device user's support contact when enrolling the device. Going forward, just a single contact phone number can be used as a contact resource. #Added Microsoft Intune MDM support With this release, KME is supported by Microsoft's Intune EMM solution.

Additionally, Samsung has now completed work for supporting KC + KME + Android Enterprise Managed device mode to increase opportunities for KC. KC can be launched from a KME enrolled device, by either selecting the device's back key, or from a displayed device notification (as illustrated below). When using KME with Knox Configure, be careful when unchecking the Leave all system apps enabled checkbox, as this may lead to conflicts with Knox Configure. For example, when setting the Samsung browser homepage, the Knox Configure policy will fail \\[51010] if system apps are disabled (since system apps include the Samsung browser). Frictionless customization Currently, when an error occurs during device enrollment, the enrollment process stops, regardless of the error type, and a failure is reported to the KC server. The current messaging is often inadequate to properly define the scope and severity of the issue that is stopping enrollment. This implementation of this feature enables an IT admin to better distinguish and categorize enrollment errors and warning messages. Enrollment now continues when a warning occurs, but stops when an error occurs. The Device log now has better descriptions and links to specific warnings and error conditions. Improved device screen grid definition Currently, the Home screen grid options do not provide enough customer preferred choices. As a result, new 4x6 and 5x6 options have been included to provide administrators a better selection for a growing set of supported device models (such as the new GalaxyS9+). Additionally, the grid selection drop-down menu has been moved into the Device screen preview field for better logical placement of the grid selection option. ProKiosk mode enhancements To date, when Knox Configure updates a device and the device's ProKiosk mode has already been set by a customized app other than Knox Configure, a failure occurs regardless of the normal or ProKiosk mode profile type. However, if a normal mode profile is used, the Knox Configure update can be completed without a conflict with ProKiosk mode. To remedy this situation, a Knox Configure normal mode profile is now compatible with ProKiosk mode using a customized app with cSDK without a failure. License key enhancements To date, a license can be entered only if the Knox Configure License name is unique to all customers. However, there is no way for a user to know if name is truly unique across all customer deployments. To remedy this problem, the License name duplicate check logic has been revised from all customer deployments to an individual customer's pool of licenses. Second APN resource with the same parameters now permitted To satisfy a customer request, a second APN resource with the same APN resource parameters (name, apn, mcc, etc), can now be configured and entered within the Knox Configure console. While adding multiple identical APN resources has been supported on the device-side for some time, it is only with this current release that an identical APN resource can be defined and made available within the KC console. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Background push updates now permitted This enhancement enables an IT admin or system integrator to push an updated profile or application to Samsung Gear wearable devices without any related UI displaying on the target device. This enables the wearable device user to continue to use their device without interruption, as profile or application updates occur in the background. #Frictionless customization Currently, when an error occurs during wearable device enrollment, the enrollment process stops, regardless of the error type, and a failure is reported to KC server. Additionally, the current messaging is inadequate to properly define the scope and severity of the problem that halted enrollment. This implementation of this feature enables IT admin to better distinguish and categorize errors and occurs. The device log also better describes the warning or error condition encountered. #Watch face alteration and deletion prevention This feature addresses requests by IT admins who need a dynamic profile restriction policy option that prevents wearable device users from changing their device's watch face, once it is configured and set on the device. #Disallow application uninstall This feature enables an IT admin to configure a list of applications that cannot be uninstalled by the device user post enrollment and deployment. Removing an application from the disallow uninstall app list removes the uninstall restriction, and provides the device user the capability to remove the application from their device. If utilizing a setup edition profile, just a single application is permitted in the uninstall prevention list. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #KME+DO with KC support added KME added support for Android Enterprise managed device mode in Knox 2.8 (on S8 and higher device platforms).

IBM has provided Samsung the JSON data they provide Google for DO provisioning. `` The characters highlighted in red above are new JSON attributes IBM wants to include with their DO support. IBM are using a two-letter key/value with a 500 JSON string character limit. #MDM support for Citrix DO added With this release, Samsung has included Citrix DO (Work Managed Device) support within the KME DO drop-down menu. The following is a sample JSON: ``` } ``` #Activity log now displays and filters devices enrolled with NFC or Bluetooth To date, IT admins have been unable to see devices in the KME activity log that were added using NFC or Bluetooth. With this release, both NFC and Bluetooth enrolled devices can viewed and separately filtered within the activity log's Event column, along with those devices added into KME using a typical KME console enrollment. Reseller Portal The following reseller portal improvements are available with this release: #Improved MPTS performance The following reseller portal improvements are available with this release: Currently, the reseller portal processes uploads asynchronously. To reduce processing time, messaging for small uploads is bypassed and are processed immediately, reducing the number of messages in the queue and quickening message processing. The reseller portal sends multiple batch IDs to the MPTS script. To date, there is a 30 second delay added for MPTS processing of each batch. This delay is eliminated by using MPTS scripts to accept multiple batches. The MPTS delay has been reduced from 30 seconds to 5 seconds. Another API has been added to the reseller portal to take multiple batch IDs and return device details to the MPTS script. The MPTS script has been modified to call the newly added API and process the batches in a multi-threaded manner. The reseller portal has added multi-threading while claiming upload events. This ensures 1-2 large uploads do not hold up the queue and add latency to other uploads. Back to release notes",

KLM/SKL license activation for specific applications This enhancement enables the activation a KLM or SKL license for applications installed using Knox Configure. If using Knox SDKs, some applications still require Knox license activation. This enhancement reduces the burden placed on partners to implement Knox licenses within Enterprise application(s). Device-side UX refresh To date, numerous Knox Configure device screens have yet to improve from their legacy KCC design. To address this, the Knox Configure out-of-box device experience has a simpler flow and user navigation, reducing the number of screens a user encounters when setting up their device. Additionally, the new UX provides detailed feedback of a device's configuration progress for a better understanding of the steps involved and wait times, including app download and installation progress, and filename and download progress. Enhanced CSV profile configuration To date, IT admins are unable to optimally input configuration settings using the CSV file format. With this new feature, multiple inputs can now be provided with a CSV file or copy & paste, including: _Setup edition_: Disable the use of other applications (Max 10) within the Applications & content section. _Dynamic edition_: Disable the use of other applications, prevent applications from being uninstalled, application restrictions (applications blocklist, applications allowlist), application URL restrictions (applications, URL blocklist, URL allowlist) within the Applications & content section. APN selection for E-Billing improvements To date, the APN, MNC and MCC were not distinguishable when selecting an AP resource for a profile's E-Billing configuration. With this release, the KC console's UX has been updated with more granular APN, MNC and MCC data per drop-down menu option. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) #KLM/SKL license activation for specific applications This enhancement enables the activation a KLM or SKL license for applications installed using Knox Configure. If using Knox SDKs, some applications still require Knox license activation. This enhancement reduces the burden placed on partners to implement Knox licenses within Enterprise application(s). #Device-side UX refresh The KME device experience now has a simpler flow and navigation. In particular, the number of device screens has been reduced to shorten enrollment times, enrollment progress screens have been merged into a single screen, and the Finish screen has been replaced with a notification. The updated UX design matches the latest Samsung Experience (SE9) for a seamless setup wizard experience. Detailed enrollment progress is provided so users can better understand the steps and subsequent wait times. The language displayed on the device has also been updated to reduce user uncertainty. #DuoSTATION MDM support In response to a DuoSTATION request, DuoSTATION now has Google DO (Work Managed Device) support for KME.

            "content": "Knox Configure 1.14 release notes. Knox Configure (KC) #Updated KC console UX design The Samsung Knox team is introducing new versions of our industry-leading Knox Configure (KC), Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), and Knox Deployment Program (KDP) consoles to provide optimal uniformity among our growing family of device enrollment and configuration solutions. The central update with each console is the introduction of a collapsible left-hand navigation menu, replacing the previous horizontal menu bar. This provides a visual-hierarchy of key enrollment and configuration console activities and administrator \"call-to-actions.\" The new consoles are personalized, with improved status updates from each user's previous login. Colorized status indicators optimally display \"at-a-glance\" event severity to administrate with best in class efficiency. #App downloads can now occur in the background Currently, applications are downloaded in background by default after configuration. However, if some applications are related to other configurations they are downloaded during configuration. #Push update schedule enhancements To date, a push notification for an update is sent as soon as an IT admin clicks the push button. However, some customers have requested the ability to send push notification updates at a specified, or scheduled time. With this release, admins can use a new scheduling facility to select the calendar date, time of day, and time zone a push update occurs. #USB configuration enhancements This feature allows IT admins to define which particular USB restriction classes to enable or disable for a configuration profile. Before this release, the USB interface was either enabled or disabled completely. This feature is supported on Knox 2.9 and above supported devices, and only using Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles. #Proxy setting for Wi-Fi now available To date, there is no proxy Wi-Fi settings for a smart phone or tablet profile. With this release, proxy settings are supported for Wi-Fi with both phones and tablets, and not just wearable devices. \"A device can now connect to a specified network with credentials delivered by Knox Configure using a proxy to communicate externally. #Profile assignment enhancements IT admins have requested the ability to assign a profile automatically to devices uploaded by a specific reseller. With this release, customers can now reduce the number of profiles administrated by eliminating device model dependencies, this will help reduce their burden when assigning devices to profiles. #Disable location service capability added To date, Knox Configure supports an option to disable GPS, but location services can be supported with Wi-Fi and mobile networks. However, some customers have requested the ability to disable location services completely. With the introduction of this feature, dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles have the option of disabling GPS, Wi-Fi and mobility network location services. This option is supported on mobile devices running Knox version 2.7.1 or later. #Multiple admin invitations within single CSV file To date, a primary admin can only invite other admins manually, and only one admin at a time. This can be a cumbersome activity when numerous admins require an invitation. With this release, a CSV file can be read into the console to invite additional admins using their name and Email address. #Google Play app shortcut optimizations Currently, when an IT admin adds a Google play app to a Knox Configure profile, its shortcut is included within the Recommended apps folders by default. This folder's name and directory can be changed by an IT admin, but customers have requested the ability to add the shortcut to the device's home screen. To address this issue, a Google Play application shortcut option has been added. The selected Google Play shortcut will display on the home screen. #Disable specific application updates Customers have requested a mechanism to disable the update of specifically allowed or blocked applications. To address this issue, the profile configuration Applications & content screen has been updated to include an Update blocklist/allowlist item where admins can list those specific applications they want to either include or exclude in an update. #Device side configure.samsungknox.com page update Currently, a device's configure.samsungknox.com page displays a GET LATEST button that states \"Get latest configurations. Please make sure this device is already configured at least once.\" Some customers report confusion as to the expected behavior once the button is pressed. To remedy this confusion, the button name has been changed to RE-ENROLL TO KNOX CONFIGURE. Additionally, the descriptive text displayed on the screen has been updated to the following: \"Re-enroll to Knox Configure with latest configurations. This will remove KC agent from this device and enroll it to Knox Configure again. Please make sure this device is already configured at least once.\" #Permissions for special access The Knox team has received requests to remove the installation permission screen when installing and executing applications. To address the issue, an admin can now turn on and off each permission as deployment requirements warrant, and permission exceptions now result in a warning and no longer block Knox Configure enrollment. Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #WKC + custom app configuration capability To date, when the ProKiosk mode is set using a custom app, a failure occurs during KC configuration. However, if previously applied profile and a new profile do not have a ProKiosk mode setting, KC does not have to show a failure for the ProKiosk mode set by the other app. #Option added to prevent device user from making settings menu or status bar changes With this release, IT admins can now create a dynamic edition profile and select an option to prevent a device user from accessing the Settings menu. The UX displays that this feature is only available on Tizen 4.0 and above devices, and the device must be in standalone mode. #WKC enrollment via the Knox Deployment App To date, WKC enrollment is conducted only during the initial out-of-box network search. An end user needed a factory reset to begin enrollment when the device is already in use. Additionally, wearable devices should be registered to the Reseller Portal RP by resellers, because when the IMEI/SN is not registered by resellers, they can't use WKC. With this release with Tizen 4.0 and above devices, an IT admin no longer has to factory reset wearable devices, and can self-verify devices by connecting each wearable device via Bluetooth using the Knox Deployment App. Admins\"can simply start Knox Configure enrollment using a hidden action in Setting menu.

Knox Configure (KC) #DeX mode configuration DeX mode configuration is now available with Knox Configure on devices running Knox version 3.2 or higher. Samsung DeX is a unique product that lets you use your phone as if it were a desktop computer. Both Setup and Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles are supported, but not ProKiosk mode profiles. The following device platforms support DeX mode with Knox Configure: _Phones_ - S8/S8+, Note8, S9/S9+, Note9 ~ (flagship only), _Tablets_ - Tab S4 Supported features include: Home screen customization, Clear default shortcuts, Ability to add shortcuts for apps and URLs, Ability set wallpaper for home and lock screens, Auto launch specific apps when DeX mode starts, Disable DeX mode as well as apps in DeX mode #EULA updates available after profile submission To date, a customer cannot update the Terms & Conditions portion of their EULA after a profile is configured and applied to the device. \"With this release, revisions to the Terms & Conditions are now available after the profile is applied to the device. The language in the console's EULA section is also revised, and now mentions that you can add your own terms and conditions and/or privacy policy. #No reboot required for entering ProKiosk mode With this feature, a device reboot is no longer required to enter into ProKiosk mode when enrolling in Knox Configure or conducting a push update. This feature is only supported on devices running Knox version 3.2 or above. Only a Knox Configure device agent update is required to implement this feature. #Disable specific app components This feature addresses customer requests to disable their native Samsung device Contacts app and use a third-party Contacts app as an alternative if they so desired. This provides greater flexibility and addresses customer concern for flexibility beyond Samsung's default device options. #Prevent specific apps from stopping/closing This feature addresses requests to prevent specific apps from closing or stopping for purposes such as battery savings. With this feature, both the system and device user are prohibited from closing or stopping the listed app. This feature is supported with Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles. #Traditional Chinese language (\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587) console support To date, Knox Configure's Chinese language support did not extend beyond Simplified Chinese. However, Taiwanese customers have requested the Knox Configure console support Traditional Chinese characters (\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587) as well. This Knox Configure release includes Traditional Chinese amongst the list of supported console languages. Back to release notes",

This has resulted in an undesired user experience, and can result in unnecessary or repeated device actions. To remedy this situation, the Knox Configure console now auto-refreshes when certain status updates are detected. The following actions and events now result in an auto-refresh within a currently displayed Knox Configure screen: Device assignments and un-assignments, Push updates, Device locks and unlocks #Notification center enhancements To date, the Knox team has received numerous suggestions on how to improve the Knox Configure console's notification efficiency. To date, the notification center retains notifications for just one login session. When a user logs out, notifications are cleared, and when they log in again, new notifications are triggered as applicable. However, holding notifications for just login session is too limited and can result in missing important notifications. To remedy this issue, notifications will remain on the Knox Configure console, but will now disappear 7 days after being read or acted upon depending on the notification type. #Device Reboot enhancements To date, Knox Configure can factory reset specific IT admin selected devices. However, customers have also requested the ability to reboot selected devices. With this release, factory reset and reboot are both available for devices in a _Configured_, _Updates pushed_, or _Failed to configure_ status. A reboot is triggered without prompting for user consent. This feature is available for Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles (both normal and ProKiosk mode) on devices running Knox version 2.7.1 or above. #Enrollment customizations for special access permissions This enhancement provides a new screen notifying a device user of special access permissions assigned by the admin for specific apps. #APN setting updates for Setup edition profiles To date, APN settings have only been supported in Knox Configure Dynamic edition profiles. However, numerous customers have requested APN setting be made available in Setup edition Knox Configure profiles as well. With this release, the same APN settings available for Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles are now available for Setup edition profiles. #Ability to switch off predictive mode text To date, Knox Configure supports Keyboard settings in ProKiosk mode. However, customers have requested a feature to switch off predictive text, but keep keyboard settings enabled. As a result, the\"ability to switch off predictive text has been added to this release as an additional keyboard customization option. This feature is available for both Setup and Dynamic edition (Normal mode only) profiles on devices running Knox version 2.7.1 or above. #Disable auto fill forms within Samsung Internet browser This enhancement enables admins to enable and disable the auto-fill forms option within the Samsung Browser. Admins can now enable/disable the Browser auto-fill forms option within a Dynamic profile's Browser settings field within the Knox Configure console. This feature is available for Dynamic edition (Normal mode only) profiles on devices running Knox version 2.7.1 or above. #Download content in background during profile configuration To date, device content is downloaded during device configuration. With this feature, content is downloaded in the background by default, but selected Knox Configure content specified within the Download content during configuration is downloaded during device profile configuration. #Deprecate profile ringtone setting for Knox version 2.9 and above With the Knox 3.0 version release, ringtone settings were no longer supported as a Knox Configure profile configuration option, but the parameter for selecting ringtone remained in the console, creating confusion for administrators. To remedy this confusion, a tooltip has been added to the Knox Configure console explaining that the Ringtone option is no longer\"available for devices running Knox version 3.0 or later. This makes this configuration option available to legacy Knox versions, while skipping the ringtone setting from being applied to a profile configuration on Knox 3.0 and above devices. #User consent option added to custom Terms & Conditions updates With this release, an option to Request end user consent to updated terms and conditions has been added to the Terms and Conditions portion of the profile configuration flow within the Knox Configure console. When selected, end users must agree to the updated Terms and Conditions before these terms are committed to their device. If this option remains unselected, any updates to the Terms and Conditions are passed to the device user with the Knox Configure profile whether they agree to these terms or not. #User interface search function improvements Currently, users may not know how the search function optimally works within the Knox Configure console. The console's search capabilities are case insensitive within most tables, but case sensitive in some tables, such as the Devices tab, since the vast number of devices require case sensitivity. A partial match search is supported for each search parameter, but an exact match is applied to a device IMEI/SN. Additionally, a blank space between search keywords means an AND condition The following are the tabs within the Knox Configure console, and the searchable columns or parameters within each. These will be better described in the Knox Configure User Guide beginning with this release: _Profiles_ - PROFILE, _Devices > UPLOADS_ - RESELLER, _Devices > DEVICES -_ DEVICE ID, PROFILE, MODEL, TAGS, _Devices > DEVICES Device deletion log -_ DEVICE ID, MODEL, ORDER NO. DELETER, _Licenses -_ LICENSE NAME, KEY, _Applications -_ Application name, Package name, Description, _Administrators -_ ADIMINISTRATOR NAME, EMAIL, _Activity log_, NAME, CATEGORY, EVENT, DESCRIPTION Wearable Knox Configure (WKC) #Companion mode support added IT admins can now maintain profile configurations assigned to wearable devices using Knox Configure while end users can switch between phone connection (WPC) mode and companion mode. Additionally, a profile can be configured on the wearable device while connected to the phone. This feature maintains the device configuration during a mode change, and the companion mode configuration, so device users can use their configured wearable device with the phone connection. Companion mode is available to wearable devices running Tizen version 4.0 and above. #APN setting updates for WKC Setup edition profiles To date, APN settings have only been supported in Knox Configure Dynamic edition profiles for wearable devices.

Once created and uploaded, an admin can preview and verify the animation before assigning to devices. When added into the console, the animation is available as a .qmg file for profile assignment and a MP4 file for preview within the console. Once verified, an admin can create a profile with relevant settings and add the animation file. The admin can then push the profile to specific assigned devices and check to ensure the devices are configured properly with the animation file. #Location/GPS concept change page with Android P With this release, the GPS option is removed from the Device connectivity section of the KC console and replaced with Location for Android P. All related APIs are deprecated. The same GPS parameters as previous will still remain within the console, but they will be changed to Location parameters. This feature is supported on Knox version 2.9 and above devices with both Setup and Dynamic edition profiles. All new KC version 1.19 profiles will have this user interface update, and previously created profiles will retain their legacy GPS settings for backward compatibility. #New email notifications for pending license expiration This feature addresses customers reporting difficulty recovering unassigned devices due to license expiration without adequate expiration messaging. SLM license expiration warning emails are typically sent incrementally months in advance of the actual expiration date, but the email recipients may not be the appropriate admins responsible KC license administration. Therefore, with this release, KC will send email reminders to IT admins 2 months, 1 month, 2, weeks, and 1 week in advance of the license expiration date.\" A typical reminder email contains the license name, type, license key, license key quantity and validation period. This new email notification enhancement is supported on both Setup and Dynamic edition KC profiles. A new version of an existing app can also be easily updated within the profile edit page by selecting add new version. #Wi-Fi direct enrollment support added to KDA This release introduces a new enrollment option in addition to the existing KDA Bluetooth and NFC enrollment options. Wi-Fi direct supported devices can connect directly to one another via a WLAN without joining a traditional wireless network or Wi-Fi\u00ae hotspot. Once enabled, the device automatically scans for other supported Wi-Fi direct devices. Once discovered, specific devices can be selected for enrollment data transfers. With Wi-Fi direct, only out-of box _trigger_ deployments are supported. Trigger deployments utilize a plus sign (+) gesture on a device's Welcome screen to start an out-of-box deployment and bypass the setup wizard. To utilize the Wi-Fi direct option, the receiver device must be utilizing Knox version 3.2 or above. Additionally, only Note9 and Tab S4 and above devices are supported. Wi-Fi direct is not supported on wearable devices. KC for Wearables #Simplified wearable app (.tpk) deployment process This feature addresses administrator requests to upload a .tpk file into the WKC console for use with wearable devices. With this enhancement, Administrators no longer need to register apps to Galaxy. A descriptive error message will display when an unsupported file format is uploaded, or if the .tpk file exceeds a specific size. An administrator can also now add an uploaded application to a profile when in a \"Ready to deploy\" status. Email notification now sent to user when an application signing succeeded or failed event occurs allowing for faster response to a failed signing event. #Option added to disable NFC and restrict users from turning on/off This feature enables an IT admin to Disable NFC and restrict device users from changing their device's NFC settings.

Knox Configure (KC) #Role-based access control (RBAC) improvements This release introduces a new _Role Based Access Control_ (RBAC) service allowing customer (tenant) admins that are responsible for account creation (Super Admin) to assign more refined role permissions to individual admins as their specific enterprise requirements dictate. Though KC utilizes admin roles unique to that service, a Super Admin cuts across all supported services. With the new RBAC service, existing customers will have their administrators migrated automatically with the next Knox Cloud Service release in Q1 2019. Administrators with their own unique set of permissions (manage administrators, delete devices etc.) will be assigned new roles that map to their current permissions. If needed, new roles beyond what the migrated admins are currently assigned can be created based on a list of permissions unique for each service. The only role that cannot be assigned is the Super Admin role, which applies across all supported services. Only one person can assume a Super Admin role per company. Upon migration, the Super Admin role is assigned to the person who originally created the customer account. The Super Admin role receives every permission option available. #Knox Cloud Services on same device, device deletion concept This feature introduces a new device deletion concept when KC is utilized with other Knox Cloud Services. If a device is only used with KC, its removal is a typical hard deletion, and the device is removed from both KC and the Reseller Portal. However, if a device is used with both KC and another Knox Cloud service, like Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), it is deleted from KC only (soft deletion), and remains in KME. #Adaptive Wi-Fi setting optimizations This feature addresses customer requests to a llow devices to switch from WiFi to mobile data when necessary. These new options have been added to existing device profile WiFi Device Connectivity settings. These new Wi-Fi settings assist large enterprise deployments when it's not scalable to manually make WiFi changes per device. This feature is supported with both Setup and Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles, and on devices running Knox version 2.7.1 and above. #Mock location disable mode This enhancement addresses customer requests to disable a mobile device's mock location capability that, when enabled, displays disguised data, as opposed a device's actual location information. To support this requirement, a new Disable mock location option has been added to the Device connectivity field's LOCATION area (formally GPS). Selecting this option disables mock location applications within the device Develop options.

Knox Configure (KC) #New \"Per Device Staggered\" license for Setup edition profiles This feature addresses customer concerns to only activate a setup edition license once each device is actually activated. This enables customers to utilize licenses more efficiently, since a customer may not initially use KC after it is purchased, or deploy devices at the same time. Using a new Per Device Staggered license, a customer creates a Setup edition profile and assigns devices per usual. They then however select the new Per Device Staggered license and ensure each activated device has a different expiration date based on each device's activation date. Existing Knox Configure SKUs will be kept as is, and are not impacted by this change. The new Per Device Staggered license will be available subject to country. #New \"Per Seat\" license for Dynamic edition profiles This feature enables customers who want to revoke a license on one device in order to use the license, \"per seat,\" on another device with the same dynamic edition profile. For example, an IT admin may want to revoke an ex-employee's license so they can utilize that revoked license on a different device using that same Dynamic edition profile. Utilizing the revoked license increases the available license count and improves license provisioning efficiency with the Dynamic edition profile. Existing Knox Configure SKUs will be kept as is, and are not impacted by this change. The new Per Device Staggered license will be available subject to country. #Multiple licenses now assignable in a profile To date, a profile and an assigned license were linked, so a profile could not be created without a license assigned. To remedy this limitation, a profile and an assigned license are no longer linked, and each device now follows the behavior of the license types they belong to. Additionally, legacy SKU licenses and new SKU licenses can now be used together in the same profile, and if necessary, a profile can be created and saved without a license assignment. #Knox Deployment App (KDA) profile creation license enhancements With this release, a license is now assigned for the KDA explicitly at profile creation as an optional step, if enrolling using the KDA. Licenses utilized with legacy profiles that were created prior to this release will be automatically migrated to the KDA licenses.\"Only one license can be designated for the KDA, so if it is consumed or expired, an admin will need to assign another one. No license selection workflow is available with the KDA. Instead, a predefined license is used for the KDA uploaded devices. #New ability to turn on/off carrier data when roaming This Knox Configure console enhancement permits IT admins to enable/disable device users from accessing and using carrier data when roaming. A new Default Data roaming settings drop-down menu within Profiles > Device Connectivity will include Keep current settings (the default setting), On, and Off. If Off is selected, the drop-down menu is disabled. It will be appropriately noted that selecting On and using mobile data when roaming could result in additional charges. This feature is supported on Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles in normal mode. #App notification allowance This feature addresses IT admin requests who do not want their device users distracted when accessing and reviewing status bar notifications at work or driving a vehicle. Specifically, this feature provides a Knox Configure console addition within Profiles > Applications and Content to optionally disable notifications, including both pop-up notifications and status bar notifications for: All apps (both system notifications and application notifications), All apps except specific allowed apps This feature is supported on Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles in normal mode. #Limitation added to administrator invitation roles To avoid the further escalation of Knox Configure administrative roles and permissions issues, an existing admin who does not have a Manage roles permission requires additional restrictions regarding the roles they can assign to other administrators. With this release, existing administrators without a Manage role permission can only invite admins with a matching set of their own role permissions. As a result, the Invite administrator screen's Role drop-down menu choices have been customized for the particular role of the admin creating the invitation. #Disable second device SIM slot This feature addresses administrator requests to disable a device's SIM slot 2 to achieve control over a device's SIM bays, and stop users inserting personal SIM cards in dual SIM devices. This SIM enhancement is particularly in demand with Government and Public sectors. This feature is supported on Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles (supporting either normal and ProKiosk modes), and devices running Android P OS and above (Knox version Knox 3.2.1 and above). #Blue light filter settings added This feature has been added in response to education and vertical customers who have requested blue light filter settings be added as profile configuration options. The blue light filter is helpful to reduce brightness at night when trying to sleep. This setting is on/off profile configurable. When turned On, an Opacity slider is enabled. This feature is supported in both Setup and Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles. #Limit access to Knox Configure web portal With this new permission, you can now create a role that can only access KC via the Knox Deployment Application, and not via the web portal. #Lock screen timeout added This feature has been added in response to IT admins who would like to lock the device screen after a configurable period to enhance security and data protection. This lock screen timeout setting persists even after a firmware update. From the Home & Lock screen area, select Set automatic lock time and use the drop-down menu to select the idle time between the screen timeout, set in the Sound & display area, and the device lock time. This feature is available for Knox Configure Dynamic edition profiles in normal mode on flagship devices. Back to release notes",

Knox Configure (KC) #Admins now capable of being invited to multiple services To date, an admin is unable to invite another admin belonging to a different Knox Cloud Service. With this release, a Super Admin or an admin with Admins' permission can now invite an admin belonging to a different service to a role in their service. For example, Admin 1 belongs to just KC with a non-Super Admin role. Admin 2 belongs to KME with a non-Super Admin role, but has Admins' permissions. Therefore, Admin 2 can invite Admin 1 to join KME for any role for which Admin 2 has permissions. #KDA only access permission added This feature addresses IT admin requests to only use the Knox Deployment App (KDA) for enrollments, and not access any of the KCS portal resources (including the Knox Configure console). When relying exclusively on the KDA without the Knox Configure console, an admin must login into the KDA, choose a service (KC, KME, etc.), select a profile, pair the primary/admin device with a target device, and then assign the profile to the target device. Additionally, a KDA access permission option is added into the Knox Configure Create role screen to provide administrators the ability to grant permission to enroll devices directly into Knox Configure using the KDA. #Knox Deployment Application (KDA) v1.2.25 released to Google Play Store The Knox Deployment Application v.1.2.25 is now available from the Google Play Store. With this release of the KDA, profile ordering is now done alphabetically. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Configure 1.22 release notes. Knox Configure (KC) #View only administrative permissions added This KCS enhancement addresses customer requests to assign an administrator view only permissions. Once assigned, no profile configuration, device management, license, or reseller administration is permitted, just view only access. When a View only radio button is selected, all nested options under that category (Profiles, Devices and Uploads etc.) are disabled. Additionally, if a radio button has nested options and that category does not have View only selected, at least one of its permission checkboxes must also be selected. New roles have View only enabled by default. #Italian console translation available In response to Italian customer requests, customers and subsidiaries in that country have requested to ability update Italian text with their own regional translations. Impacted areas within the console include: Dashboard, Devices > Devices, Licenses, Licenses > Activated Seats description, Feedback & Support > Resources, Profiles > Create a profile > Select edition, Profile editing > Applications and content, Profile editing > Sound & display, Library > Media > Actions > Add media > Create animation #Invalid error display on devices not supporting Korea or certain devices To date, the KC console displays an error message when a customer registers an application to Galaxy apps and doesn't select Korea from the supported country list or does not select certain devices. With this release, a package name is now added without error when it has registered in Galaxy apps with a StubAPI permission. #Improved error messaging for wearable application verification To date, an IT admin cannot adequately determine the cause of an app upload failure, since the current messaging is too general to drill-down to specific causes. With this release, both the UX strings and corresponding error code definitions have been refined to be more informative to an actual event and now enable an It admin make more informed corrective actions. #Profile snapshot view enhancements To date, if a device was configured, or failed to be configured, a profile snapshot displays when a user clicks on the profile name in console's Devices tab. If the applied profile is not the latest, its version displays in red beside the profile name. However, in snapshot view, there is no difference between latest one and old one, except for a version mark, and the user is often confused as to the correct version. To resolve this confusion, a note now displays within the snapshot of the old profile stating a newer version of this same profile is available. If needed, a user can update to the newer profile by push update from the snapshot page. #Profile deletion improvements To date, when a profile is selected from within the console's Profiles tab, the Delete profiles option is disabled from the Actions drop-down menu, even though the profile is not assigned to a device. The user, not knowing the reason this option is disabled, is understandably confused. To remedy this situation, the user must consent to the profile deletion within a pop-up message. However, if there any default profiles selected for deletion, a message displays stating they cannot be deleted since they have already been uploaded by the listed reseller. #Media file deletion improvements To date, admins have been only able to delete a single obsolete or unused media file at a time from the console's media library. With this release, IT admins can now optimally select and delete multiple media files from within the KC console, as long as the files are not associated with any profiles. This feature only supports the deletion of multiple qmg formatted media files, and does not include mobile and wearable applications. #Improved console text for similar processes Inconsistencies have been noticed between the use of _BLUETOOTH Enrolled device_ within the console's Device log and _Uploaded via Bluetooth_ within the Device details screen. As result, there has been reported confusion as to whether these two text strings are conveying the same message. To rectify this inconsistency and avoid confusion, Uploaded via Bluetooth has been removed from the Device details screen's Order number field (and replaced with a tag), and the text string within the Device log is now changed to _Device enrolled via Bluetooth using Knox Deployment app_. Similar console text refinements have also been made for NFC and Wi-Fi enrollments. #Profile licensing enhancements for KDA enrollment To date, there's no option within the KC console to add a license key when configuring a profile to use with the Knox Deployment App (KDA). When configuring a profile in KC, the KNOX DEPLOYMENT APP SETTINGS field License drop-down menu only provides a means to select an existing license for a KDA enrolled KC profile. To remedy this situation, a new Enter License Key option has been added to the Licenses screen. The Enter License Key option can be selected when there are no profiles available to automatically move to the Enter license key screen. From there, a License name and License Key can be added that then become available for selection from the License drop-down menu. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Configure 1.23 release notes. The following are the new features and enhancements introduced with this KCS 1.23 release: Knox Configure (KC) #Option to skip the device welcome screen during enrollment To date, a customer has been unable to skip the KC enrollment welcome screen to optimize their enrollment. With this new option, the welcome screen is skipped. #Customizable device enrollment screens With this release, admins can now customize their device enrollment screens with consistent experience across the screen flow. A background image and a logo are shared for each screen in the enrollment flow. The text within the welcome screens remains customizable. If a customer doesn't choose to customize the enrollment screen flow, then the default Knox Configure enrollment screens and KC images are used. #Simplified enrollment progress display To date, the current device configuration screen displays detailed app and file download information at different completion intervals. This has resulted in not user-friendly experience for B2B2C end users and too much information for the most of actual use cases. To remedy this situation, only a single simplified progress bar now displays in the foreground during configuration that reports cumulative downloading app and file progress at 10% increments. Background configuration items are not included in the displayed progress number. #Application versioning enhancements To date, applications display in the app list without their current version information. Consequently, if there are several versions of an application it's difficult to update the application in each profile, since the user needs to remove the current version in profile first, add the new version to the library, then add the new version to the profile again. To help resolve this confusion, apps are now listed separately, with each displaying its current version, app name, description, profile assignment, size, and last modification date. Admins can now change an application's version information within the profile edit page by adding the new version information, then selecting it from the drop-down menu. #Bookmark shortcut improvements To date, a default icon displays when a bookmark shortcut is added by Knox Configure to a device homescreen. This default icon is supposed to change to a permanent icon (apple touch icon or favicon of that Web page) when the device user visits that page using the device browser. However, the actual behavior is no icon change at all. With this release, a bookmark added by Knox Configure appears uniquely from those added by the device's supported browser to better differentiate Knox Configure added bookmarks. #Passcode for deleted devices If a Locked device is deleted by a customer, reseller, or the Samsung Knox Team, a push notification for enabling a factory reset is sent to that device, and the device user can factory reset it in recovery mode. However, if push notification is delayed or not sent at all due to network issues, the device user cannot use that device until the notification is received. To remedy this situation, the passcode for a Locked device is now retained within the device deletion log when the device is deleted, and no status change is reflected in the log. #Activity log updates for administrator events With this release, the activity log has been enhanced to provide a broader range of administrator event changes. These administration events include, administrator invitations, administrator modifications, recent/reactivated/revoked invitations, and deactivated/reactivated accounts. #Tooltip updates for blue light filter settings To date, the blue light filter has not been working properly for devices that utilize a S/W blue light filter (SM-T580 and SM-A105G). To provide additional coverage for this potential issue, the existing tooltip has been updated as follows: \"The Settings menu and quick panel might not reflect the selection made here, but the policy will be applied. And, this feature may not work properly in some devices which use S/W blue light filter. It is recommended to test before deployment.\" #Warning message improvements for profile un-assignment It has been reported to the KCS team that some customers do not know that un-assigning a profile from a device makes the device uncontrollable, and a push profile update is no longer possible. \"Consequently, more descriptive warning messaging is required to reduce the number of potential issues when un-assigning profiles. The updated messaging will closely resemble the following: \"Warning: Once a device is unassigned from a profile, it is not controllable from the console until it is enrolled and configured with a profile once again. So, a push update and/or reboot/factory reset is not possible.\" Back to release notes",

However, when attempting to upload 2-30 images and selecting Generate, it often appears the animation upload is not loading properly. The animation creation popup no longer displays, but the animation progress indicator appears to be processing normally. To resolve this potential confusion, the animation upload processing time has been substantially decreased. \"This should help reduce the confusion as to whether the animation upload is stuck when processing a large number of files. Option to skip the Knox privacy policy and KC terms & conditions during enrollment With this release, customers can optionally prevent both the Knox Privacy Policy and Knox Configure Terms & Conditions from displaying on end user devices during the enrollment. This option is only supported with Dynamic edition Knox Configure profiles upon the agreement of a disclaimer. The disclaimer displays upon the creation of each profile, but only one confirmation is required per profile. Bulk invitation enhancements To date, users are reporting confusion by the messaging displayed when uploading an invalid CSV file supporting bulk invitations. Specifically, there is no adequate workaround instructions for invalid input within the CSV file template that would help users properly prepare their CSV file. To remedy this confusion, additional guidance has been added to the CSV file template (downloaded from the console's Bulk invite administrators screen) to reduce user uncertainty. Specifically, the following additional information has been added to the CSV template: # Before uploading the CSV, please erase the explanation line beginning with '#' # The row: First name, Last name, Email address is the header row and cannot be deleted # Next row will contain information of admins that you want to invite # Each row below header need to have first name, last name and email, separated by comma # First and last names cannot contain numeric characters # Email address should follow valid format as name@domain # Each field can have maximum 60 characters Device state tooltip enhancements To date, the Knox Configure console has utilized an incomplete set of tooltips for status and event indicators. While the following new set of tooltips do not satisfy the complete list of tooltips needed, they do provide a more thorough set. New tooltips include: Dashboard > profile cards, Dashboard > main device status cards, Profiles > device details popup when user clicks on any number in 'Total Devices' column, Devices > status column in table, Single upload > status column in table, Config console > devices tab > status column in table Dashboard view link enhancements To date, there is a separate View link for each upload displayed on the Dashboard that, when selected, efficiently navigates to the single upload page. Additionally, for licenses there is a View all link that, when selected, navigates to the Licenses screen. However, when there is an alert issued for license, the user cannot properly review the individual license directly, and must manually navigate to the Licenses screen and locate the impacted license. To remedy this shortcoming, the View all link has been removed from the Licenses screen and replaced with individual View links for each displayed license. When selected, a License details popup displays on the dashboard for the selected license without having to manually navigate to the impacted license. Library media screen enhancement To date, the Library screen's Media tab displays an empty page when there is no media content available. This is of no assistance to users with no idea how to add media. To remedy this issue, the Media tab has been enhanced with helpful information, testing recommendations and an image that should be of better assistance when an empty Media tab is encountered. WKC profile information now consistent with mobile devices In response to the KCS July 31 release and its mobile device updates within the Profile information portion of the console, the following similar updates have been made for WKC for consistency: Support contact information is partitioned into a new section entitled Support contact details, Add additional terms and conditions is now located within a new Device enrollment section, and is now entitled Agreements, Enrollment settings is now entitled Enrollment preference and moved under Device enrollment, The Enrollment screen is now entitled Enrollment information, The Knox version is now hard coded and no longer a drop-down menu option, The Allow end user to cancel customization option is now entitled Allow end users to cancel enrollment Add a description when adding an app To date, a user cannot include a description when they add a new version of an existing application using the Library screen's Add application version option within the ACTIONS drop-down menu. To remedy this shortcoming, a user can now provide a description when adding a new version of an existing application. The description is helpful to an admin who may be finding it difficult deciding which version to utilize with an existing profile. #Disable administrator account data when invalid data is input To help protect sensitive data administrator data, if any of the fields (First name, Last name, Role) are updated with invalid data, the administrator account data on the screen is now disabled until valid data is provided.

Support for non-Knox Samsung devices With this release, separate profiles are now configurable for Samsung devices without Knox Platform for Enterprise. Going forward, an admin will have the option of configuring a profile Secured by Knox or Other Samsung devices. When configuring a profile, an admin is not required to select a Knox version. The remainder of the profile configuration closely resembles the existing process and screen flow. However, the following profile restriction options and payloads are disabled: Auto power on, Disable Camera, Disable USB classes, APN setting, Disable OMC mode, SIM lock PIN, Kiosk mode and device lock, WiFi APN provisioning These profiles are only assignable to Other Samsung devices. When IMEIs are uploaded into the KC console, Knox supported devices will not be accepted into these profiles. When an upload fails, an appropriate message displays for either individual or bulk upload failures. The KDA enrollment of Other Samsung devices is not supported for either Knox Configure or Knox Mobile Enrollment. Advanced features Beginning with this release, Knox Configure will begin providing enterprise IT administrators a schema-driven user interface, allowing admins to remotely configure, change and manage device settings. These settings are unique to Samsung device models, and are not provided by Android Enterprise. With this KCS 1.25 release, only an Advanced features section will be added from the Deep Settings schema introduced with Knox 3.4. There will be no impact to existing profile configuration categories with this addition. The following Advanced features are introduced with this release: Smart stay, When enabled, the screen remains unlocked as long as the device camera can detect your eyes looking at the screen. When you put the phone down or look away, the device will turn off based on the screen's current timeout settings. Smart alert, When enabled, smart alert informs the device user of missed calls and text messages by vibrating the phone when its picked up. Easy mute, When enabled, easy mute allows you to mute incoming calls and alarms by placing your hand on the screen. On Galaxy S8, S8+, S7 and S7 edge platforms you can also mute calls and alarms by placing the phone face down on a flat surface. Palm swipe to capture, When enabled, this feature allows you swipe your hand across the device screen to capture the current device display. Once captured, the image resides in the screenshots album/folder in the gallery. Swipe to call or send messages, When enabled, this feature allows you to call or send messages by swiping your finger across a contact's information in the phone or address book. Web Kiosk mode The Web kiosk solution addresses requests from Enterprises who want to improve the customer experience in their facility by presenting product descriptions, comparisons and demonstrations. Such Enterprises want to leverage tablets to better message their key services through the improved customization of their Kiosk services. In particular, an a dmin can configure WebKiosk mode supported profile to support the following features: A single home screen with custom wallpape, Home screen bookmarks with custom icons, When WebKiosk mode is enabled, the following browser customizations are applied: Customer webpage bookmarks with unique customizable icons , Disable tab view functionality , The ability to clear the browser cache and cookies , Address bar removal MVNO details added within APN settings Starting with the P OS (Android 9.0), some APNs now require the _mobile virtual network operator type_ (mvno_type) and _mobile virtual network operator_ (MVNO) value (mvno_value) be set together. These mvno_type and mvno_value fields allow an APN configuration to be restricted when using particular MVNOs or subscriber accounts. Without this setting, custom defined APN configurations are selected according to MCC and MNC only, which specifies the mobile network a mobile device subscribes to, but not the particular retailer or reseller, or account on a network. To address this new requirement, Knox 3.2.1 and 3.3 devices can have their mvno type set to one of the following options during profile configuration: None, SPN (Service Provider Name), IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity), GID (Group Identifier Level 1) Devices running Knox version 3.2.1 or 3.3 must be flashed for this feature to adequately function. Shared device and E-billing deprecation With this release, the Knox Configure client will ignore shared device and E-billing configurations on devices running the Android Q version operating system and above. \"The KC console provides a warning for now unsupported status of shared device and E-billing on the Q version operating system. If the shared device feature was already enabled on an existing device, and that device was FOTA updated to the Q version operating system, the shared device feature should be disabled when a newly applied profile has shared device disabled. WKC booting animation enhancements Currently, booting animation, and sound are not cleared from a wearable device as expected when the Set a custom booting animation option is unselected, and an update is pushed to the device. \"Additionally, if the Set a custom shut down animation is unselected and an update is pushed to wearable device, shut down animation should also be cleared, including sound. To date, WKC always checked if existing animation was set by a previous WKC profile, and would not remove it if set for a previous profile. To remedy this situation, users can now remove booting or shutdown animation separately by ensuring either option is not selected when pushing an update. WKC enrollment improvements To date, when a wearable device has 15% power or less remaining and is in a Profile assigned state, enrollment is halted when authenticating after accepting the terms of the EULA. Once the wearable device is rebooted, the expected result is to resume enrollment. However, enrollment is not resumed after power save is enabled and then disabled before reaching an activating license state. To remedy this enrollment problem, power saving is disabled, then enabled back after license activation so enrollment is not interrupted. Auto select application upload improvements To date, if you upload a new application into a profile, it is not selected automatically. You need to click the application icon again to ensure the expected check mark appears. This can be confusing, since the reason applications are typically uploaded is to deploy it immediately with an update. To remedy this confusion, with this release a newly added, but not selected, application will be added as long as the application version is added as well. Status bar tooltip enhancements in kiosk mode In Kiosk mode, when customers select Hide Status Bar from the Home & Lock Screen they believe this action will hide the status bar, but it is still available when dragged down. To remedy this confusion, the tooltip has been updated to the following, \"This method shows or hides the status bar. If the status bar is hidden in normal mode, every application will use the entire display space for itself. Notifications will therefore be hidden from the user. The status bar will still be available if you drag it down. The Soft Navigation bar will be hidden from the user as well and available if you drag it up. Dashboard widget enhancements When there are no profiles in an account, the dashboard should show a Create profile button in place of the profile widgets. Beginning with this release, when there are no profiles in an account, the dashboard displays a Create profile button instead of the profile widgets. Selecting it starts the profile creation screen flow. If there are profiles in the account, the button displays Select a profile to pin here. Selecting it displays a popup where the user can add profiles to the dashboard. Add IMEI to lock screen email and send from KC settings When an admin locks a delinquent user's device, the user typically sends an email from the device's Locked or Support screen in an attempt to unlock their device. Within the email page, the device identifier is the serial number. However, the IMEI has already been utilized to upload and enroll the device into Knox Configure. Additionally, the customer typically has no visibility of the serial number and are unable to identify the device. This has exposed the need for an easy to locate device IMEI to better assist locked device users. To remedy this issue, a new IMEI field has been added to the existing serial number field, as long as the IMEI is available (the IMEI is not available on Wi-Fi only devices). Going forward, when a customer receives an email, they should have better access to the device IMEI. Back to release notes",

Enhanced app validation during APK upload for version upgrade Currently, Android does not allow App updates with a signature other than the installed App. To update an App on a device with a newer version of the same app (a signature different than the installed version), the installed app must be deleted. Consequently, issues have been reported after App versioning was first introduced with the Knox Configure 1.23 version release. To remedy this issue, when an admin now uploads a new version of an App, if the signature is different than signature of the last successfully uploaded version of the existing App, then the upload is rejected with a console error message. Additionally, when an admin uploads a new version of App with the same signature as the existing App, the upload is permitted.

Additional profile configuration settings Continuing with this release, Knox Configure is providing admins additional schema-driven updates to remotely configure, change and manage device settings. These additional profile configuration settings are unique to Samsung device models, and are not provided by Android Enterprise. These additional profile configuration settings are available to Normal, Setup and ProKiosk profiles. These additional profile configuration settings are only available to devices running Knox version 3.4 and above. Supported devices are exposed to these additional profile configuration settings within the existing Home & lock screen, Sound & display, Device connectivity, Device settings, and Security settings profile configuration categories. Enhanced battery and power management settings Admins have requested better Knox Configure battery life options to provide their device users an experience that avoid loops due to low remaining battery life. With this release, an admin now can set a limit when the device battery stops charging once it reaches a maximum setting of 85% total power. This new setting is available within the Device settings portion of the profile configuration screen flow and is available to tablets devices only running Knox version 3.4 and above. This enhancement helps admins better control battery thresholds while also providing a maximum charge setting of 85% to avoid issue associated with keeping the tablet on its charger too long. EAP now available for wearable devices Customers are currently unable to deploy wearable devices in areas where enterprise Wi-Fi is required for internal communication. Requesting customers want to connect to a staging profile, deploy a profile, exit Kiosk mode on the wearable, authenticate into an Enterprise Wi-Fi (EAP-PEAP), pull-down a certificate, then re-deploy a Kiosk supported profile. However, this is not practical for deployments supporting thousands of wearable devices. To remedy this issue, an admin can now create a profile and set its Advanced Wi-Fi setting's security type to 802.1x EAP (using either PEAP or TTLS). Once the admin associates target devices to this profile, they configure the deployment area's AP resource with 802.1x EAP as a hidden state. The admin then verifies that the configured devices have Wi-Fi connectivity. The implementation of this feature affords administrators the ability to provision large numbers of EAP Wi-Fi supported wearable devices at once time and save a substantial amount time and money in the process. Download profile summary as a PDF To date, admins have requested the ability to download profile settings in PDF to review profile settings. Such admins report that a PDF provides an easier means to both review settings and use the output to create profiles in other accounts. With this release an authenticated user can now download profile summary settings in PDF. The PDF output closely resembles the KC profile summary page displayed once a profile is configured and saved. A profile PDF can be generated from either the Profile configuration dashboard or the bottom of the Profile summary once the profile configuration is configured. The PDF does not exceed 5 MB, and has a UTC timestamp of the time it was downloaded. This enhancement affords admins an easier means to access profile configuration settings when creating profiles for other accounts, thus saving time and money. Re-assign devices to current license after renewal To date, when a Knox Configure license expires, a profile is unassigned from its assigned device. However, customers often want to renew their existing license used by deployed devices, but when the license is renewed, customers are unable to re-assign their devices. Additionally, when an unassigned device is assigned a profile using a renewed license, the devices are consuming new seats even though they have activated the license before. To remedy this license utilization issue, devices no longer consume new license seats when re-assigned to profiles using the same license. However, devices need to be manually selected within the KC console and re-assigned the license. This enhancement enables customers to re-assign their unassigned devices to a profile and reuse a renewed license without consuming additional license seats, saving both time and money. WebKiosk mode default inactivity timeout To date, there is no inactivity threshold to terminate a WebKiosk session and reduce exposure of sensitive user information when a Kiosk user does not properly end their session. To avoid the exposure of sensitive information, admins require a short inactivity value to close an open WebKiosk browser session and reduce the window sensitive financial information is exposed. To reduce this exposure window, a WebKiosk browser session is now invalidated, closed, and reset to the home screen after 5 minutes of inactivity without an admin having to pre-define an inactivity timeout manually for the Kiosk supported profile.

Allow role deletion for admin states This feature addresses IT admin requests to delete a Knox Configure admin role with a pending, revoked or blocked state (any state but active).

Existing administrators assigned to the role must be re-assigned to another role before the deletion can proceed. Any pending, revoked, or blocked admins assigned the deleted role are assigned a role of NoRole. Profile update notification improvements Currently profile app update console notifications are not sufficiently clear. Specifically, when a failure occurs an administrator cannot discern the appropriate reason for update failure amongst the possible failure scenarios. To address this issue, the failure notifications have been updated to provide a clearer explanation of the failure root cause. Unique failure notifications are now in place for the following scenarios: Request is empty or null, Selected app does not exist, Latest version already in use with some profiles, Latest version already in use with all profiles, App not yet added to any profiles Success and partial success notifications remain as previously implemented. License activation end date notification enhancements Currently, when a license activation end date changes its difficult to discern the new end date from the previous one. To reduce end date confusion, the License activation end date has been updated from to <NewActivationEndDate. WKC version number addition To date, there is no way for a user to determine which version of WKC is running on their wearable device without looking at device logs. The Android version of KC resides in the Settings -> Apps Menu. However, WKC cannot access this information due to the structure of the Wearable Settings menu. To address this issue, the WKC version number now displays in a more visible location within the device's App Info screen for the benefit of those who need it. Deep setting tool tip enhancement The existing Hotspot 2.0 AP connection tooltip is lacking in sufficient detail to be truly helpful. To help remedy this uncertainty of this tooltip, it has been updated to read as follows: \"Seamlessly connect Hotspot 2.0 enabled Wi-Fi access points without needing a password. Hostspot 2.0 with be turned off automatically if \"Do not allow\" is selected. If you want to turn it on and prevent the user from changing this setting, please select \"Do not allow and Hide setting.\" Back to release notes",

MS Teams hot key mapping template customizations This key mapping update addresses Samsung's strategic partnership with Microsoft Teams and the goal to include additional important customers in the near term. Such customers want to add customization to key mapping support as a device enrollment and configuration function using a KC profile. Customers can use KC to remap device keys to launch an app and send specific intents to the app. Additionally, customizable hot key remapping combinations are supported. For instance, launch one app with a short press action and another app with a long press action. Select either a Custom or Microsoft Teams template for hot key mapping based on the intended key mapping configuration. The Microsoft Teams template provides a single click option for IT admins to seamlessly enable walkie talkie functionality with Microsoft Teams for XCover Pro or Tab Active Pro devices. To review an impactful Microsoft Teams walkie talkie mode support announcement, go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/01/09/8-new-capabilities-microsoft-365-empower-firstline-workers/. When complete, review the configurations customized for specific key mapping templates, keys, key press types, actions and application packages. Remaining license seat display optimizations Going forward, remaining license seats only display within the main Knox Configure Licenses screen. This should reduce reported confusion in respect to discerning remaining seats from both assigned and activated seats. Improved Enterprise Edition (EE) device differentiation Currently, there is no way to optimally filter and differentiate EE from non-EE devices within the KC console. This has resulted in reported frustration by users wanting to filter EE supported devices. To remedy this poor console behavior, the EE tag next to the model number has been moved to the TAGS column in the Devices and Device details screens to provide improved filter capabilities for EE devices. Additionally, an EE tag now displays as Enterprise Edition, and looks like existing console tags for consistency. Back to release notes",

KC Super Admin API access permissions This feature enables Samsung Admins to provide KC API access permissions to requesting tenants, and in doing so, creating a new workflow from the KC portal to the KAPI portal for IT admins. Once a Samsung Admin grants API access permission to a tenant, the tenant's primary admin must also have the permission enabled. Once the admin has permission, they can subsequently grant it to other admins supporting the same tenant. Disable Wi-Fi blocking This enhancement addresses customer requests to disable Wi-Fi network blocking on Knox Configure supported devices. Though Samsung devices have Wi-Fi network blocking enabled by default, some customers report AP connection and battery consumption issues that may not occur if there was an option to turn off Wi-Fi network blocking. To address this issue, an option to Disable Wi-Fi Network Blocking is now included with existing profile Advanced Wi-Fi settings. A maximum of 5 SSIDs can be defined and configured with this setting. Disable Wi-Fi Network Blocking is available on Knox 3.5 and above supported devices, and XCover Pro devices running Knox version 3.4.1 and above. Third party device keyboard support This enhancement addresses administrator requests to add a 3rd party keyboard on devices managed by Knox Configure.

Hot Key Remapping, Custom Intent Support This feature addresses admin requests to specify a custom remapping intent as specified by a 3rd party solution willing to consume events sent from KC for applicable device actions. KC should send the intent to the 3rd party based on IT admin's trigger setting. For example, long press, short press etc. New options added in Key Press Type include: Key Press, Key Release The new option added in the Action Type includes: Send Intent (Only shown when Key Press or Key Release is selected as the Key Press Type). A new text field is also now available to capture the intent format added below the package name field. It only displays when Send Intent is selected as Action Type. The intent can be secured by the following permission in manifest. `android:permission=\"com.samsung.android.knox.permission.KNOX_CUSTOM_SETTING` Allow different tags in the same bulk upload CSV Knox Configure supports the tagging of both individual devices and devices in bulk. Devices get the same tag. Tagging is a practical to identify which device is used by which user. However, checking devices one-by-one is not efficient, and while bulk tagging is easier, it would be better still to have devices use different tags. Beginning with this release, an admin can specify different tags for each device in an uploaded CSV. For example, IMEI1, IMEI2, IMEI3 -> Tag1; IMEI4, IMEI5 -> Tag2; IMEI6 -> Tag6. The overwrite of an existing tag is permitted with the uploaded CSV. The maximum number of tags per device is 10. QR code provisioning support This feature supports admin requests to enroll a device into KC using a QR code, in manner resembling how KME supports QR code enrollment currently, using either a reseller or via a direct upload. _Reseller upload flow_ - IMEIs need to be uploaded by the reseller and be assigned to a profile that has a QR code associated with it. _Direct upload flow_ - For non-validated QR code enrollments, the device does not require a previous reseller upload. Devices can be directly enrolled without a primary device and KDA app. By default, an IT admin uses the validated reseller upload flow option, but can also utilize the non-validated QR code enrollment option if needed. Once configured and associated with a profile, a QR icon displays to the right of a listed profile within the KC profiles screen. When selected, additional QR code enrollment options can be defined. This feature is supported on both mobile devices and tablets, but wearable devices are not supported. Both Setup and Dynamic edition KC profiles are supported. No special license is required for QR code enrollment support in KC. QR code enrollment is only available on Android 10 and higher devices, and this new option can be added to new and existing Knox 3.4 or above profiles. Improved enrollment failure handling (error code: 21005) Currently, when error condition 21005 is encountered enrollment is blocked, as opposed to a more constructive warning issued when a signature mismatch in the uploaded app binary occurs. To improve productivity with this release, profile configuration and enrollment can now continue when error type 21005 occurs. A generic installation warning message now displays to the admin instead of enrollment being blocked completely. For the end user, enrollment should proceed as is. Previously, an error was displayed blocking enrollment. The warning for a lower version has been removed since KC is ignoring the application's versioning. Support additional hidden network and Internet proxy DNS addresses Wi-Fi options, KC for wearables A hidden network doesn't display on the device Wi-Fi manager, and a manual connection isn't possible. It's often easier to provision the devices with KC instead of sharing the SSID/PSWD with each employee using a wearable. While Knox Configure can push Wi-Fi profiles, there is no hidden profile option or proxy address input unless it is an IP Address. With this release, support has been added within the Device connectivity screen for additional Wi-Fi options, including hidden network SSID and Internet proxy DNS addresses. This feature is supported on wearable Knox Configure devices only, supporting either Setup or Dynamic edition profiles. For more information, go to: Setup edition or Dynamic edition for wearable devices. Support additional Wi-Fi options (Wi-Fi Always ON), KC for wearables This feature enables wearables deployed in factories, and other large areas, to remain connected to their preferred corporate Wi-Fi network so urgent updates pushed by IT are received on time. With this release, an option has been added within the Device connectivity screen to Keep WiFi always on. When selected Wi-Fi remains continuously on, even when the battery is low. Keep in mind, enabling this setting prevents Wi-Fi from being turned off under any circumstances. Power saving mode and Airplane mode are disabled when this option is selected, and once set, users are unable to change the Wi-Fi on and off settings. This option is available to both Setup and Dynamic edition KC for wearable profiles. This feature is supported on wearable Knox Configure devices only, supporting either Setup or Dynamic edition profiles. For more information, go to: Setup edition or Dynamic edition for wearable devices. Offline deactivation, KC for wearables This feature addresses KC wearable admin requests to factory reset a wearable device after temporary usage or when no longer needed. This request becomes problematic when the Bluetooth connection between the paired phone and the wearable is broken, and there is no way for WKC to send a wipe and reset command and factory reset the wearable via the recovery mode. To address this issue, the WKC agent on the wearable will be invoked to perform a factory reset manually, even if there is no current Bluetooth connectivity. Profile configuration recommendations Going forward, Knox Configure will provide profile configuration recommendations and caveats that may prove extremely useful for your organizations profile configuration and deployment objectives. These useful suggestions will also assist admins to both discover and utilize new features and settings. These recommendations are created uniquely for customers using machine learning algorithms.

For example, if a KC customer has the same profile for every device, it does not make much sense for the IT admin to login to the portal just to assign. This step can be eliminated if the reseller can point to the appropriate KC profile at the time of the upload itself. With this release, a profile alias can be created in the KC console and shared with a reseller, who then attaches the alias to an upload. This, in turn, can be used as a profile auto-assignment rule. Customers don't always want to share their actual profile names with resellers. With an alias, they can use a more user-friendly name. For example, they can use the alias \"_Coke-campaign1_\" instead of the actual profile name, \"_v1.23_Coke-compaign1-*6712_\". Profile aliases are not shared across resellers, so they do not need to be unique across resellers. However, they do need to be unique for each reseller. Up to 10 profile aliases can be created per reseller, and a profile can be associated with 1 or more aliases. Aliases are optional, but when utilized, need to be associated with an existing profile. When an additional profile with an alias is added, additional mandatory fields appear: Profile, License and Profile alias. If the license associated with the alias is expired or if its seat count is 0, disable the auto-approval when the profile is assigned. For details, see Assign automatically on upload by reseller. IT admins that choose to use this feature must ensure that the reseller knows which alias to use per upload. This feature should only be used if they have coordinated with the reseller regarding which profile alias to use. Otherwise, the devices may not be auto-assigned correctly. Device custom ID support A custom ID is an ID that you create to map to an IMEI or SN, which are no longer accessible by device apps. Company apps deployed through KC can use it to identify the company approved devices and allow use only for these devices. For this reason, Knox Configure will allow IT admins to set a custom ID per device. The custom ID will be used as follows: 1. A customer uploads their device IMEI/SN with a custom ID to the KC server. 2. When the device is enrolled in KC, the KC server provides the mapped custom ID. 3. The KC client stores the provided custom ID using the Knox API provided by the Knox framework. 4. The partner app provides the custom ID of the device when the partner app sends a request through the Knox SDK. Only partner apps deployed through KC can read the custom ID using the Knox API (`DeviceInventory.getKnoxServiceId` in Knox SDK version 3.7). When a customer updates their custom ID, they need to ensure it's also updated in KC. There are two ways to update the custom ID in KC. Update the custom ID within the Device Details screen for each ID update, Update custom IDs using a bulk file upload containing as many custom IDs as needed. For details on bulk upload see Map devices to Custom IDs in bulk. Device Knox Version and OS version available in console This enhancement assists admins to access a device's Knox version and OS version from within the KC console to better diagnose potential issues. Beginning with this release, the device Knox version and OS version are available as customizable display options within the KC Devices screen and also displayed for a selected device within the Device details screen. This data is collected during enrollment for new devices. For existing devices, this data is retrieved during next agent update. For more details, see Device details and logs.

KC Profile template IT admins in specific sectors - such as Education, Finance, and Healthcare - sometimes need to set up and configure devices and user profiles with more ease than currently offered in KC. This release includes a new feature - Profile Template - that offers recommended configurations with default settings for a particular industry The profile template offered in KC is intended as a starting point for creating a profile and explains how to apply specific features in the KC console to configure the device's status. Using the profile template as a starting point, IT admins can test features and configuration settings before creating custom profiles to meet their specific requirements. Some of the settings prepopulated for each industry are as follows: Education - Setup devices quickly for students or teachers by configuring recommended education settings to enhance their learning and teaching experience as well as restricting harmful information. Healthcare - Setup devices quickly for medical workers or B2B2C subscribers by configuring recommended healthcare settings to have your customized branded devices secure and stable. Finance - Setup devices quickly for finance workers by configuring recommended finance settings to keep devices secure and stable. To use these recommended configurations and templates, on the Profiles page > click CREATE A PROFILE > click Select Device > select industry. IT admins can just follow on-screen instructions to continue with the recommended configurations. For more information regarding profile creation, see Create a Setup or Dynamic profile.

Support Samsung Kids Configuration Starting with this release, IT admins can easily customize mobile devices for B2B2C customers to make the devices kid-safe. Samsung Kids (SK) Configuration lets partners create their own version of the Samsung Kids app. IT admins can now easily upload custom data using the KC console to customize the company-branded SK app. Samsung Kids is pre-installed in all Samsung devices. Users can easily use the feature from the quick access panel, and can set the Samsung Kids icon on the home screen or menu and run the app. Parents or administrators can protect their children from harmful apps or websites through Samsung Kids as well as set a custom playtime limit countdown. Parents can set whether to show apps that are installed in the general environment on Samsung Kids. Additionally, there are special apps and contents targeted specifically for kids that are included in the Samsung Kids environment. To exit from the Samsung Kids environment, the user has to enter the password that was set by parents when setting up SK. Through the SK Configuration, IT admins can customize the features as follows: 1. Add apps on the Samsung Kids Home screen. 2. Change the layout of the Samsung Kids Home screen. 3. Change the Samsung Kids Home screen wallpaper. 4. Change the native app name or icon. 5. Change the Samsung Kids installer/Welcome screen and Play timeout/Phone contact image. 6. Set App access allowlist. 7. Set Browser web bookmark and URL allowlist. The process to customize SK for B2B2C devices works as follows: 1. The IT admin creates a SK profile which allows to configure normal and SK items. SK configuration supports both the setup and dynamic edition. SK supports devices running Android Q OS or higher. 2. If the IT admin wants to upload their own APK and add a new layout for SK, IT admin should upload custom APKs in Application and Widgets. 3. IT admins can configure supported features such as layout, wallpaper, and native app customization. From the KC console guide, the IT admin can easily upload custom resources such as APK, PNG images, and mp4 video. 4. IT admins can configure other features for normal profile out of SK app as well. 5. After setting up the KC configuration in the OOBE environment of the device, the Samsung Kids is automatically launched and a screen allowing the device user to set the PIN code is shown. Parents can now set the PIN code on the device, and after setting up the PIN code, Samsung Kids launches. The parent can use the PIN code to set the playtime up a playtime limit countdown or restrictions of in the Samsung Kids environment or exit from Samsung Kids. Configure enhanced Kiosk Mode (Multi-app) The ProKiosk mode in KC allows IT admins to restrict a portion of a device's functionality to just a specific set of targeted applications. Starting with the Knox service 1.39 release, the IT admins can now set up a Multi-App Kiosk profile, that allows multiple preset applications in the ProKiosk mode. Additionally, the IT admin can use the Multi-App Kiosk mode to: Limit device functionality to a single app or a set of apps and a group of settings, Set up a custom Home screen for use with the Multi-App Kiosk mode, Specify one or more of the following configuration options: Bookmarks If the device user clicks a bookmark, the browser opens to the specified URL after clearing the cache and history settings. The device user also does not have access to any other browser options such as Home, Settings, or other tabs. Apps When the Multi-App Kiosk mode is active on the device, the device user cannot manually edit any of the configured information or access any other apps installed on the device. To use the enhanced Kiosk mode, the IT admin must set up a multiple applications mode profile using the KC portal and push it to devices from the KC console, Profile Create or Detail > ProKiosk mode > Home and Lock screen settings section > Settings list > options available are Single App Kiosk or Multi App Kiosk mode. Prevention of EE License generation for EE devices after August 2021 Currently, Samsung Knox Portal Customers can generate a Knox Configure EE - also known as EE Legacy License - using SamsungKnox.com. This functionality is being deprecated starting August 2021. Customers can continue to assign EE Legacy Licenses to device models launched before August 2021. When they try to assign an EE Legacy License to device models launched after July 31, 2021, they see an error message informing them that this functionality is not supported. After July 31, 2021, Knox Suite licenses are replacing EE licenses. As a result, when assigning licenses to EE devices, customers can assign a normal (non-EE) KC license to their devices. EE device support using existing KC license (Non-EE KC license) Starting with this release, the non-EE KC license can also be applied to EE devices. This change follows the previously mentioned change that starting August 2021, devices can no longer be assigned EE licenses, and need a normal (non-EE) KC license instead. Non-EE devices cannot use an EE KC license. \\[MSP] Share license key support Starting with the Knox service 1.39 release, MSP admins can now add, share, and delete KC licenses from the MSP portal so that MSP can manage KC licenses more effectively. The MSP can now: Generate a KC trial key on the MSP portal to test sharing concept amongst fully managed customers. Enter a KC commercial key on MSP portal to share a key with multiple fully managed customers. Delete a KC trial or commercial key on MSP portal for fully managed customers, when license has expired and no devices are assigned. View the license detail information on MSP portal. Consumption of actual licenses, that is assigning licenses to devices or profiles, is done from customer's KC portal. Replacement of licenses on the MSP portal is not available with KCS 1.39. \\[IT Admin] Admin Portal Log in page improvement, Apply special Samsung Account log in page The Knox service 1.39 release adds a new login flow for the KC Admin Portal that is, the Samsung Account's special login page and results in improving the security of user accounts. This page mandates the use of dual authentication methods for logging in. As a result of this change, when logging in the IT admin has to enter the following policy: For the first login of user, the page mandated the use of dual authentication such as security certificate, mobile authentication, one-time password (OTP), or VPN, Passwords must meet the required complexity level dictated by the system. Samsung admins are required to change their password every three months. Adaptive Brightness On/Off, For not supported device, add tooltips (Phase 1) When setting the Adaptive Brightness feature to On or Off, IT admins now see a tooltip informing them that this feature is not available on all devices as some device models do not have a light sensor which is necessary to support the auto-adjustment of brightness levels. Deprecated item, swipe_to_call_or_send_messages Knox v3.7 or higher, available with the Android R or higher OS, does not support the swipe to call or send messages setting. Starting with Knox service 1.39, this setting is deprecated and is no longer in use. IT admins are informed that this setting is only available only for devices running Knox v3.4 to 3.6.

IT admin can select an option to self-uninstall Knox Configure agent after device configuration When creating or setting up profiles in Setup edition of Knox Configure (KC), IT admins can choose to set a self-uninstall flag that allows the KC agent to automatically uninstall after profile configuration is complete. The user can specify whether this functionality is available on the device when they are setting up or modifying the profile. This feature primarily helps B2B2C partners who are not interested in giving a full set of permissions for their minimal use-cases such as rebranding or minor configuration changes. The process works as follows: 1. On the KC console, when setting up a new profile, the IT admin selects the Self-uninstall checkbox. If this option is selected, the KC console only shows reduced options in the console. 2. Depending upon the options selected, KC applies the device configuration to the target device. 3. Upon successful implementation of the device configuration, the KC agent is automatically uninstalled. 4. For devices that require a factory reset as part of device configuration prior to the license expiration, the KC agent uninstalls itself after the device resets and successfully includes the device configuration options. IT admin can set Knox Configure Routines to support context-based configuration Knox Configure now supports adding routine applets. This involves codeless automation for use cases that allow the programming of a response to events based on various factors. These routine applets are features powered by the concept of automated actions triggered by context, to make device usage more streamlined. The automated response actions are triggered by context clues such as time, battery level, and charging status. Simply put, B2B enterprises use many device management solutions to configure static device settings using cloud based platform for their employees or target devices. Also, for B2B2C cases where the end customer receives the device use just simple app deployment/layout configuration. This static configuration has no flexibility around the device context. Now, Knox Configure supports trigger (If) and action (Then) conditions like below table. If: what will trigger this routine. Then: what this routine will do.

After routine applets end, the device's condition will be reversed. End user can enter ProKiosk mode from KC Settings This release introduces the ability to set multiple applications in the KC ProKiosk Mode with an added functionality to enter and re-enter the ProKiosk mode quickly by entering a passcode on the device. Device users who have exited the ProKiosk mode can now quickly re-enter that mode by entering a specific passcode on their device. This feature reduces the dependence on the IT admin pushing an update to the device to restart the ProKiosk mode. IT admins can set this passcode during the profile creation process, specifically in the Home and Lock screen settings for entering into the ProKiosk Mode. To re-enter the ProKiosk mode, the device user goes to the Knox Configure Settings screen, and when prompted enters the passcode to re-enter ProKiosk Mode. IT admin can remap side key Starting with this release, IT admins can remap the side key to custom functionality for Knox 3.7 and above. The options available for this custom remapping are as follows: Double-press of the side key, IT admins can choose to allow or restrict the device user from double-pressing the appropriate key. IT admins can turn this setting on or off. Turn on or off , Quick launch camera , Open Bixby , Open specific app, Press and hold of the side key , Wake Bixby , Power off menu, Allow user to customize, IT admins can choose one of three settings: Allow the device user to customize the action , Do not allow the device user to customize the action , Do not allow the device user to customize the action as well as hide the setting from the use KC blocks OS FOTA upgrade before KC agent enrollment Previously, when setting up new devices after the OOBE setup wizard, sometimes device users could manually download and install firmware updates (FOTA) to their devices before the device was enrolled using the KC agent. These FOTA updates were often not mandated by their IT admin and it causes an issue where the partner app doesn't work due to an OS mismatch. Going forward, IT admins can set a FOTA block for devices so that even if the device user tries to manually update the device's firmware, it is blocked on the device. Only after the new device is enrolled in Knox Configure, KC will decide to permit the appropriate FOTA update to the device or not based on FOTA block option. If IT admin sets the FOTA block on, then KC will block FOTA updates. If not, KC won't block it and the end user can select whether to accept the FOTA update or not. This restriction negates the chances of an OS mismatch on the device and ensures that all partner apps remain functional. IT admin can select the option to disable firmware updates from download mode For devices running Knox 3.4 or higher and the Samsung SM-T295 device, IT admins can prevent the device user from updating the firmware of the device in download mode. Location of contents download folder is changed from S OS With the Android S OS, apps are restricted from creating new folders under directly under Root. Bearing this restriction in mind, Knox Cloud Services folder creation is now changed. The previous file location was /storage/emulated/0/Contents and it has now changed to /storage/emulated/0/Download/Contents. Device Sync for various Knox services When registering devices to a customer from the Reseller Portal (RP), resellers cannot specify the Knox services attached to the customer account since the purpose of this registration is only to prove ownership of devices. So, when a customer subscribes to a service, all devices registered from the RP are automatically synced to the registered services. This automatic sync results in all devices, even devices not currently in use, are uploaded to the services resulting in massive data usage. This release introduces a new feature where users can manually sync devices with the appropriate Knox. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal, but the devices from the Reseller Portal are not synced automatically. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The user can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting all services, the user clicks Confirm. The user must select at least one service; without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left-hand navigation menu. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices information from the database. If the user were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If the user adds a new service that was never added, device sync will start. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 special characters: = + @ ( ). Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

For example, this November 17, 2021 release - what would have been Knox cloud service 1.41 - uses 21.11 as the version name. End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Improvements to Knox Configure Routines With the previous release, KC introduced the use of Knox Configure Routines with Routine Applets. This involves codeless automation for use cases that allow the programming of a response to events based on various factors. The automated response actions are triggered by context clues such as time, battery level, or charging status. Trigger (If) Action (Then) Condition Value Condition Value Time period Start time/End time Bluetooth On/Off Specific time HH/MM/AM or PM Mobile hotspot On/Off Charging status Charging/ Not charging NFC (Only NFC Standard mode supported) On/Off Battery level Level(&lt;=15%) +Ability to set from 1 to 15% Wi-Fi On/Off , , Sounds and vibration Sound/Vibrate/Mute , , Location On/Off , , Power saving mode On/Off , , Open an app, plus option to prevent exiting from the app Package name , , Power Off With 21.11, Knox Configure Routines see multiple improvements and feature additions. These include: Adding additional options for battery-based routines. For example, IT admins can turn off devices if the battery level is under a certain percentage. Adding the conditional ability to use battery levels below 15%. With this ability, you can select integers below 15 for battery level conditions. While 20% is still the minimum percentage the battery needs to be charged to reverse a routine, the trigger for the routine can be selected per battery level (1-15%). Displaying an error if you set up two routines with the same condition. Changing the time period UI, where the previous condition would be shown as start time: PM, and end time: AM. Now, for better clarity, time periods that go beyond the next day will be shown as ending at AM the next day. Adding NFC support in standard mode only for the time being (card mode not supported). Adding an option to prevent the device user from exiting an app if the Open an app action is used. While the user can still launch another app, like in the case of having the Gallery app open but being able to launch the Camera app, pressing the back or home button will return them to the previous app. For previously configured routines, the default value will be unchecked. Note that if the condition is only Specific time, the option will be greyed out: For more details and instructions on how Knox Configure Routines work, see KC Routines. Optimize self-uninstall KC agent feature In the 1.40, KC introduced the ability to have devices self-uninstall the KC agent after the profile is configured. The aim is to help IT admins who are not interested in giving a full set of permissions for minimal use cases, such as rebranding. In this release, additional items were added to this feature: Creating self-uninstall profiles with Samsung Kids mode. Supporting Boot up and Shutdown animations. After choosing the self-uninstallation option and device configuration, policies are maintained. See the following list for examples: Turn off screen auto-rotation, Set a custom booting animation, Set a custom shutdown animation, Brightness, Set auto brightness, Hide elements on Lock screen, Launch automatically after configuration For more information, refer to the instructions outlined in the KC 1.40 release notes. Enhance Multi-App Kiosk Mode You can now set multiple applications in KC Pro-Kiosk Mode with the ability to enter and re-enter apps quickly by typing a passcode in the device. You're able to select and add content such as PDFs, images, and videos in Multi-App Kiosk mode. There's the ability to add a content folder to store content in Multi-App Kiosk mode. To add content, select an item in the grid, then choose a content type from the drop-down. Examples of content include a bookmark, app, or a folder. After choosing your content, enter a name with a 20-character limit, and then upload it. If no name is entered, then KC uses the original file name. Support power and battery settings for XCover devices With KC 21.11, you can now configure the power and battery settings of Galaxy XCover Pro and XCover 5 devices on Android 11. The settings now work as intended with the series, and there are no battery drainage issues. There are also updates to existing tooltips to reflect the maximum charge limit feature currently applied to these devices. Note that this feature does not currently work for XCover FieldPro devices. In summary, KC now supports power and battery settings for: Devices running a Knox version higher than 3.4, Tablet devices (both normal and rugged), Mobile devices (XCover Pro, XCover 5 for Android 11 only) Any other devices not supported will trigger a warning that KC is unable to turn on the battery protection feature. It will prompt you to double check the device and the profile. Add option to skip T&C for Setup/Dynamic edition During device enrollment, you can now choose to skip the Terms & Conditions (T&C) if desired. For both Dynamic and Setup editions, this can be done by checking Hide Knox Configure T&C. If you choose to skip it, then there will be no KC T&C in EULA and in Settings. If there are no additional agreements, the entire agreements screen is skipped. If required, additional T&Cs can be added by creating profiles. Add option to disable settings suggestion pop-up After KC applies policies to the target device via Settings app customization, such as Bixby side key remapping, a settings suggestion pop-up will appear. This pop-up cannot be removed by selecting Exit. Every time a device user modifies the settings, the pop-up will appear again. The disable option is provided on Knox 3.8 and higher. In the KC console under Device Settings, an option to disable suggestion pop-ups will be provided. Change default Knox version to Knox 3.4 and higher During profile creation, the default Knox version is changed from Knox 2.9-3.3 to Knox 3.4 and higher. Back to release notes",

Knox Configure Accessories 22.03 introduces Knox Configure Accessories, which are NFC accessories for devices that are enabled by Knox Configure profiles. This new initiative easily allows KC enrollment and profile configuration through accessory pairing. With Knox Configure Accessories, accessory manufacturers and Samsung partners can easily implement accessories to instantly configure devices. Knox Configure accessories send a code to devices that are associated with a configured profile, and then enroll the device, independent of the device's upload status on the Reseller Portal. Examples of accessories include phone cases or NFC cards. This feature is available for devices running Android 10 and higher. For more information on setting up an accessory, see Knox Configure Accessories.

Support for Galaxy Theme installation The 22.08 release introduces the ability to install unique Galaxy Theme APKs for each Android version, a feature available exclusively through Knox Configure. When creating a new profile, on the Home & Lock screen step of the wizard, the options under Theme allow you to upload a theme APK file for your devices. You can also upload multiple APK files or different themes for alternate OS versions. What's more, enterprises can develop their own themes. For more information, go to Galaxy Themes on the Samsung developer web site. Galaxy Themes are unavailable on devices that don't support UI themes. Enhancements to Knox Configure Accessories Previously, accessory UIDs that weren't locked to a specific accessory type (such as case, cover, NFC card, and so on) resulted in errors during pairing. Starting with this release, when the user pairs the device with an accessory type that differs from the UID's stated type, the device opens the Samsung Galaxy Friends app. Furthermore, the deployment capacities for the UID of a Knox Configure Accessory is greatly expanded to accommodate different enterprise scenarios. The maximum number of accessories that can be associated with a profile is increased from 5,000 to 500,000. The number of devices that a single profile can be deployed to is increased to 10. This release also gives enterprises the flexibility to deploy different profiles to a single device with multiple Knox Configure Accessories. If you turn on Allow to delete device configuration, the device user can clear the profile applied from an accessory by selecting Delete accessory content in the Knox Configure agent. Then, the device user can pair the device with a different accessory, and the agent will apply the profile associated with it. If Allow to delete device configuration is turned off, and the device user attempts to pair a new accessory, the profile will fail to apply, and a message will open and prompt the user to contact an admin or the accessory manufacturer. Support enrollment for company-owned devices with work profiles With this release, company-owned devices with work profiles will automatically begin deploying Knox Configure profiles. On startup, the device user will be presented with a welcome screen with the option to Cancel the enrollment. The device user has an additional chance to cancel by selecting Return on the EULA consent screen. Remove swipe lock screen Knox Configure 22.08 adds the ability to remove swipe locks on devices.

This new customization helps device users to better understand who configured their device. To improve client accessibility for devices running Android 13 or higher, the Knox Configure client is now located in Settings & Advanced features. In addition, the name of the Knox Configure client has been changed to Configuration service with this release. You can also now pin a persistent notification to provide the device user with a quick way to access the client. If you turn on the notification, you can optionally customize the app name and message displayed in it. This release also adds accessory and routine information to the client. If the device is configured by an accessory, the device user can view information about the accessory and clear the accessory profile from the device on the Accessories tab.

After you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you can operate Knox Configure right away. If you'd like to display or register for additional Knox services, click your account icon > Settings > Show/hide services. Push update enhancements Previously, push updates sent to devices by Knox Configure would apply immediately, which could interrupt device usage during daytime hours. Starting with Knox Configure 23.03, the device user can now schedule push updates to be installed overnight. If an update is scheduled for overnight installation, the device attempts to apply the update between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM according to the current time zone. If the device is in use during that time, it attempts to apply the update the next night during the same period. If the device fails to apply the update overnight for four consecutive days, it will attempt to apply the update when the device is turned on and a network connection is available the next day. In addition, the notification now shows the total download size of the update to help the device user make an informed decision about when to apply it. You can prevent the device user from delaying push updates by selecting Push update without requesting end-user consent when updating a device profile in Knox Configure. Customizable lock screen shortcuts You can now add shortcuts to the left and right corners of the device lock screen when customizing a device profile with Knox Configure 23.03 and higher. These allow the device user to quickly open frequently used apps, such as the camera app, from the lock screen. Shortcuts can point to pre-installed apps as well as any apps installed by the Knox Configure profile. Configuration service enhancements After a device has been set up by Knox Configure, the Configuration service is installed on it. This app provides information about the applied Knox Configure profile, and includes your enterprise's support phone number and email address on the Company information screen that the device user can contact. Starting with Knox Configure 23.03, you can now add a link to your enterprise's website alongside support contact information to the Company information screen. Knox Configure Accessory improvements This release adds improvements for Knox Configure accessories. Previously, there was no way to view accessory information in Knox Configure. Now, starting with Knox Configure 23.03, you can view an accessory's UID (unique identifier) and type, the number of available accessories by UID, and the number of permitted accessories by UID. You can also download accessory information as a CSV file. Support for secondary IMEIs on dual-sim devices Previously, Knox Configure wouldn't report the secondary IMEI (IMEI2) of dual-SIM devices. Device search, device lists, and device detail pages on the console, as well as exported reports now support queries for a device's secondary IMEI. If a dual-SIM device returns only one IMEI, the IMEI is denoted by either IMEI1 or IMEI2, depending on which SIM slot the card occupies on the device. Back to release notes",

However, if you want to prevent end users from installing all other applications, you can whitelist specific applications to have the permission to be installed using the Installation allowlist feature under the Applications & Content page of your KC profile. Only the applications specified in this allowlist will be able to be installed on the device. Other applications will not be able to be installed even though Google Play is accessible. #For internal applications: If you want to install apps on your device from other trusted sources (i.e. FTP servers, company email), you can add bookmarks that link to these internal sources. Include these applications in the allowlist to ensure only trusted applications can be installed. Additional information , For more information on how to set up a KC profile, visit the Knox Configure admin guide. If you are unable to reduce your profile size using the methods above, please submit a support ticket from your Knox dashboard to request a profile limit increase.",

            "content": "How to check if the\"Prevent applications from being stopped\"policy is enforced on an app. If you applied the Prevent applications from being stopped policy to a device in Knox Configure (KC), this knowledge base article shows you how to check if an application is active, or if it is sleeping in Doze mode. This method is especially useful for devices running an Android OS version below 9, as there is no way to verify the application's running state in Settings. Prerequisites This guide assumes you are using a Windows computer with the following installed: 1. ADB Toolkit 2. Google Android USB driver How do I verify if an app is running on my device? To check the running state of an app on your device: 1. Navigate to Settings and enable Max power saving mode. The message \"Security policy restricts you from stopping this application\" appears. 2. Tap the Recent applications view. If an app appears in the list, the Prevent applications from being stopped policy is applied to it. How do I verify if an app is in sleep/Doze mode with ADB? #On your device: 1. Navigate to Settings > About phone > Software information. 2. Tap Build Number 7 times to enable Developer options. 3. Navigate to the Settings menu again. Under Developer options, enable USB Debugging. #On your computer: 1. Connect the device to your computer via USB. When a prompt appears on the computer asking if you want to allow access to the device's data, click Allow. If this is the first time the device is connected, an additional prompt with the computer's RSA key fingerprint appears. Click OK. 2. On the device, run the application you want to test on the phone. In this example, we are using the Google Chrome app (com.android.chrome). 3. In the Windows Start Menu search bar, type `cmd` and select Windows Command Prompt. #In the command prompt: Change your current directory to where you extracted your ADB files. To do so, paste in the line below and replace the file path: `cd ` Then, run the following ADB command to initiate the ADB connection between device and computer, and simulate the device being unplugged from USB: `adb shell dumpsys battery unplug` Ensure that the app you are testing is running in the background. To get the app's activity status, enter the following ADB command: `adb shell am get-inactive com.android.chrome` `Idle=false` is printed on a new line, indicating that the application is actively running and not in sleep/Doze mode. Run the following ADB command to set the application to sleep or Doze mode: `adb shell am set-inactive com.android.chrome true` Then, run the earlier command to get the status of the app again: `adb shell am get-inactive com.android.chrome` If the result is `Idle=true`, the app was successfully put to sleep. If the result is `Idle=false`, there is a device policy preventing the app from entering sleep/Doze mode. For example, this command prompt window demonstrates what you see if this policy is not enforced on the device: After testing is complete, run the following command to establish the USB connection again: `adb shell dumpsys battery reset`",

If the allotted seat count was previously used up, the customer will be unable to assign devices back to the license. Cause The KC database and license database license counts are out of sync. Resolution The KC backend team is currently working on a fix for this issue. Customer action Please raise a ticket in Salesforce from within your Samsung Knox dashboard. To ensure your issue is promptly processed, include the following with your information: Title: Renewed KC license seat count issue Description: KC Customer ID: License Key:",

If a device user attempts to set the screen timeout setting using the Settings > Display > Screen timeout console navigation path, the maximum length of time selectable is either 10 minutes or 30 minutes, depending on whether the device has an AMOLED or non-AMOLED display. Using KC, administrators can set the device screen timeout to a value greater than 10 minutes. Even if the timeout setting is applied successfully, when the device is restarted and the user navigates to Settings > Display > Screen timeout, the maximum screen timeout is displayed instead. Cause The screen timeout value has actually been applied successfully, but the console's Settings menu limits the length of time before a device screen turns off. For AMOLED displays, the maximum screen timeout is 600 seconds. For non-AMOLED displays, the maximum screen timeout is 1800 seconds. However, a KC administrator can override this UI limitation and set the screen timeout to any value between 5 to 1000 seconds. If this value exceeds the limit as defined above, the UI will display the maximum screen timeout value instead. Resolution This is expected behavior. The device screen will time out based on the value set in KC, not the maximum screen timeout of either 10 or 30 minutes displayed on the device.

            "content": "How to change configured devices to a different license key in Knox Configure. Overview This article guides you through the steps on how to switch a KC-configured device to a different license (e.g. a trial license) without unassigning the device. If the old license is about to expire, these steps must be performed before the license expiry date. When a KC\"license (trial or commercial) expires, there is a 30 day grace period to accommodate license renewal delays, after which any devices associated with the license are automatically unassigned from the profile\"they were configured to. If the same license key is renewed, there is no action required and you can continue to use the key as normal. You may also replace it with a new key within 30 days to avoid KC unassigning your devices. If a device is no longer in the \"configured\" state, KC cannot push profile updates or any other changes to the device. The device must manually trigger KC for any profile changes to be applied. There are three ways to do this: 1. From a browser on the device, navigate to configure.samsungknox.com, then select Re-enroll. 2. Navigate to the device settings > About Device > Software Info > Knox Configure > Apply latest profile. 3. Factory reset the device. If a device is automatically unassigned from KC, it remains configured to the profile unless the device user performs any of the 3 actions above. If the device is in the \"Unassigned\" state when the device user performs one of the 3 actions, then the device will be unconfigured. How do I change all my configured devices to a different license? Follow the steps below if you are: Switching all devices from a trial license to a commercial license, Switching all devices from a commercial license to a different commercial license 1. \u200bIn the KC console, under Licenses, select the old license you wish to replace. 2. Select the Actions dropdown and select Replace License. 3. Select the new license as instructed on the following page, then\"click Done. All devices previously assigned to the old license are now assigned to the new license key. How do I change only a select few devices to a different license? Follow the steps below if you are switching one device to a different license key: 1. In the KC console, under Licenses > Enter license key, add the new license key to the license tab. 2. Select the profile name you would like the devices to be configured to. If you are configuring the device to the same profile it is already configured to, you will need to clone the profile. Currently, it is not possible to change licenses within the same profile. To clone a profile, navigate to Profiles > Select the checkbox beside the profile name you would like to clone > Actions > Clone to edit. 3. Under Devices > select the Device ID of the device you wish to edit. 4. In the device details panel, select Edit. 5. In the Profile dropdown, either select the cloned profile created in Step 2 or a new profile you wish to apply to the device. 6. In the License dropdown, select the new license you wish to switch to. 7. Click Save. If you use this method, the device user is required to accept and apply the latest profile once the changes have been saved. They may also choose to postpone the update. If you want to push the update without user consent, please see the steps below. Follow the steps below if you are switching one or multiple devices to a different license key: 1. In the KC console, under Licenses > Enter license key, add the new license key to the license tab. 2. Select the profile name you would like the devices to be configured to. If you are configuring the device to the same profile it is already configured to, you will need to clone the profile. Currently, it is not possible to change licenses within the same profile. To clone a profile, navigate to Profiles > Select the checkbox beside the profile name you would like to clone > Actions > Clone to edit. 3. Select the devices tile > Actions > Assign devices. 4. Select the devices you want to assign. If you cannot find the device, ensure you are not filtering the devices by status. To clear the filter, select Status > Clear status. 5. Select Assign once all the devices you want to assign are selected. 6. Select No when a pop-up appears asking if you want to continue using the existing license. If you would like the devices to automatically receive the changes you are making, select Push update without requesting end-user consent. 7. Select the new license that you would like the devices to use, then click Submit. How do I renew my Knox Configure commercial license? To renew your KC commercial license, contact your KC license reseller. As a best practice, we recommend that you renew your commercial license instead of requesting a new one. If you renew your license, you can continue to use the same one, avoiding the steps associated with switching to a new license.",

Starting August 1st, 2021, EE Licenses will no longer be able to be generated in samsungknox.com EE devices no longer require a Knox Configure EE license key. Assigning an EE device will work the same as non-EE devices and can use the same licenses. If you still have a Knox Configure EE legacy license key, EE devices released before August 1st, 2021 can still be assigned the EE legacy license key. EE devices released after August 1st, 2021 cannot be assigned an EE legacy license key. See more information about license key management in Knox Configure here. If you encounter an error with assigning an EE device, please submit a support ticket from your Knox User Dashboard. Ensure you include the information below: _The Knox customer ID of the account_ _The error message_ _Any license specific information related to the issue_ Tags to organize Enterprise Edition devices To determine whether a device model is eligible for EE, you can now check to see if it has an Eligible for Enterprise Edition tag. On the Device Details panel, devices are now auto-tagged to differentiate between old and new EE devices. Old EE devices are tagged with Enterprise Edition and 1 more. When you hover over the 1 more tag, it displays Eligible for Enterprise Edition. New EE devices are only tagged with Enterprise Edition. The EE tags are displayed first, followed by other tags in alphabetical order.",

            "content": "Unable to invite a new administrator to Knox Configure China. There are 2 common errors that can cause IT admins to be unable to invite a new administrator to their KC console: 1. The new administrator being invited has already been invited before. 2. The new administrator invited does not receive the invitation email sent by the Knox system, but there was no error message indicating the invitation was not successful in the KC China portal after selecting INVITE. Cause To resolve issue #1, please follow the resolution outlined in the linked article above. For issue #2, it is most likely that the invitation email was rejected as spam by the receiving email server. Resolution IT admins should check email filters to ensure they can receive the verification email. If the new admin is still unable to receive the invitation email due to their filter, users can complete the invitation process by applying for a KC account (https://www.samsungknox.cn). When applying, the application will be automatically approved and associated with the primary KC account of the company that had invited them. Please ensure the administrator you are inviting is using a business email address. Personal email addresses such as @139.com, @163.com, etc, that use 3rd party email receiving servers can often reject emails coming from Samsung servers. This only applies to the KC China region. Please do not follow this resolution if you are being invited to KC in the US or EU region. Follow this article if you are not properly receiving the verification email in these regions instead.

            "content": "Renew and change Knox Configure licenses. When a trial or commercial Knox Configure license expires, there is a 30-day grace period to accommodate license renewal delays. After this period, any devices associated with the license are automatically unassigned from the profile they were configured to, and you won't be able to push profile updates, send lock and unlock commands, reboot, or factory reset your devices. Any previously scheduled pushes will also fail. If the same license is renewed, you don't need to take further action. You can also choose to replace your current license with a new one, but be sure to do so within 30 days to avoid your devices being unassigned. For more details about replacing an existing license, see License management in the Knox Configure admin guide. Who to contact to renew licenses To renew your commercial license, contact your Knox Configure license reseller. As a best practice, we recommend you renew your commercial license instead of requesting a new one. If you renew your license, you can avoid potential workflow disruptions caused by switching to a new license. What if I want to change the number of license assignments? If you want to increase the number of assignments on your existing license, you can contact your reseller to renew the license with additional assignments. If you want to decrease the number of assignments on the license, you'll need to request a new license instead. If the number of licenses assigned is higher than the number of assignments available on the renewed license, you won't be able to choose which devices are activated with the renewal. For example, say you had a license that had 20 assignments, and you assigned it to 20 devices. When it expired, you only renewed 15 assignments for the license. Knox Configure automatically selects 15 of the 20 devices previously activated on the license to activate on the new license. The other devices are then considered expired. If the expired devices aren't moved to a new license, they're unassigned after the 30-day grace period. The license details also show that the total number of assignments purchased is less than the number of activations. To prevent Knox Configure from automatically selecting devices for renewal, request a new license with the number of assignments you want, then switch the desired devices to it.

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

            "content": "About single sign-on. Simplify user access management by setting up single sign-on (SSO) for use with Samsung Knox services. As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account. Additionally, make sure your Knox account is registered as your organization's primary administrator, also known as a super admin.

For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

            "content": "Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "title": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

            "content": "Trusted Boot. Trusted Boot is a Knox Platform feature representative of Samsung's industry leading mobile device boot protection. Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps. Disable USB-connected updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from booting into Download Mode and installing a manual software update. This restriction includes updates through the Odin, Kies, and Smart Switch update tools.",

With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain. Per-app and device-wide modes - Give specific apps - for example, ones that handle confidential data - stronger firewalls, and all other apps on a device a more lenient firewall configuration. Log unsafe URL access The Knox Platform provides visibility into denied attempts to access blocked domains. The improved visibility helps you to remain aware of potential security breaches or insecure browsing practices within your organization. The Knox Platform logs reports with the following information: App name - The package name of the app attempting to access a blocked domain. Blocked domain URL - The URL of the domain name blocked by your firewall. Timestamp - The time the incident occurred, to assist with troubleshooting incidents.",

The Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated, from partner feedback and industry data, to solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider. The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

This page lists the firewall exceptions that your organization needs to use to securely reach and connect to the Knox server and its supporting resources. It includes the URLs and port numbers that you need to allowlist in order to reach the Knox servers. These server resources can include the following Knox services: _Samsung license Servers_ - When you activate Knox services, devices need to verify their license keys. Devices periodically check their licenses a few times a week. _Samsung SDS IAM & EMM_ - If you're using an EMM, devices will need to access web-based EMM consoles and storage sites. _Samsung ActiveSync Server_ - If you're using Exchange ActiveSync, you'll need an ActiveSync Server connection so the email client can successfully reach the ActiveSync Server. If your organization doesn't permit connections with external servers, you can request an on-premises Knox Server to handle license verification within your firewall. Samsung charges an extra fee for this service. For more information, contact your Samsung representative or reseller. Ports 443 and 80 must be open within your local network domain to reach Knox server resources. Knox Cloud Services can utilize both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Firebase. Both services may also warrant adding to the allowlist within your organization's firewall policy. For information on the AWS that may require allowlist inclusion, see https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to. Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account. Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service. Once you're finished editing, click SAVE to record your changes. Alternatively, you can choose to delete the role. Click DELETE at the bottom of the page to remove the role from the list and remove the associated permissions for all admins who are assigned to the role. Note that this action can't be undone.",

Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

For more information, refer to the Knox Guard admin guide. Device deletion from all Knox cloud services Prior to 22.11, if a device needed to be removed from all subscribed Knox services, it had to be deleted from each service individually. Now, admins with the Manage devices and Delete permissions and access to all Knox cloud services can delete a device on the centralized device information page after searching for it. Enhancements to Knox Manage admin management The 22.11 release adds the ability for Knox Admin Portal admins to resend and revoke invitations for new Knox Manage admins in your tenant, as well as deactivate and reactivate current Knox Manage admins, on the consolidated Administrators & Roles page.

To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Updates to Samsung Knox and Knox Admin Portal enrollment The My Knox dashboard is now deprecated, and the Samsung Knox and Knox Admin Portal enrollment flows are streamlined to reduce the barrier of entry and provide a cohesive user experience. When a new user signs into their Knox account for the first time, they're greeted with a welcome screen and can select services they want to see and use in the Knox Admin Portal. This new onboarding flow also replaces the Knox Admin Portal auto-tour. Knox Admin Portal homepage After you sign in to Samsung Knox, you are now greeted by a new homepage that contains guidance about how to get started with Knox services, including links to the latest features and support resources. All tools and resources that were previously found on the My Knox dashboard are also available through this homepage. You can set the landing page to be either the new homepage or the dashboard of a Knox service in Settings. To return to the homepage at any time, click Knox Admin Portal in the top-left corner or Home in the navigation pane.

Support for admin deletion To help control privileges and maintain the roster of admins, the 23.06 release introduces the ability to remove admin accounts of your Knox services. Super admins and admins with the Invite and manage administrators permission for all relevant services can now delete other admins, except for super admins, from the Knox Admin Portal. If you have the correct permissions, you can delete an admin by clicking their name in the admin list to edit their details, then clicking MORE ACTIONS > Delete account. This action isn't available if you don't have the correct permissions. Knox Admin Portal access for Knox Guard users In previous releases, due to technical limitations, admins who worked in a tenant that only had Knox Guard as a service couldn't access the Knox Admin Portal. As of the 23.06 release, if Knox Guard is the sole service in your tenant, you can now perform your administrative duties on the Knox Admin Portal. To quickly access the Knox Admin Portal, click Customer portal > Knox Admin Portal on the Knox Guard console. Note that only the following features of the Knox Admin Portal are available for Knox Guard users: The support center , The account details, which include options to: Edit account settings , Show or hide services, where you can also select other Knox services to register for and use on the Knox Admin Portal , Customize the default landing page Knox Remote Support The following release notes describe functionality for Knox Remote Support when accessed through the Knox Admin Portal, and not through the Knox Manage console. #Device list Knox Remote Support now provides a page called Devices, which is a launchpad for starting remote sessions with any device in your enterprise that was both enrolled and configured through an EMM, and currently has the Knox Remote Support agent installed. When you launch Knox Remote Support from the Knox Admin Portal, this page is now the default view. To learn more about the workings and efficiencies offered by the Devices page, see Manage Knox Remote Support devices. #Notification-based and automatic sessions Previously, a support session could only start when the device user opened the Knox Remote Support agent on the device and manually entered an access code that you provided to them. Starting with the 23.06 release, you can initiate a remote session with two new methods available on the Devices page: Ask Users to Start - Sends a push notification to the device with a prompt to start a session, and the device user can tap it to begin. Automatically Start - Immediately starts a support session on the device, without the user's input. This method is only available on Samsung devices that support Knox. Back to release notes",

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

            "content": "About Secured by Knox, Android - Others and Android Go devices. Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process.

If your device was previously enrolled using the + gesture, after performing a factory reset on the device, attempting to use the + gesture to enroll the device again results in this error. Resolution If a device has already been enrolled with the + gesture, you do not need to use the gesture to enroll it again as the device already exists in your account. From your KC or KME admin console, you can assign a profile to the device. Once you factory reset the device, the profile is automatically downloaded after the device connects to a network during the setup wizard.

Although the support for the oldest version is no longer available on every first major release in the year, Knox solutions are supported on the latest five major Android versions. With this change, we commit to: 1. Maintain the best-in-class product quality by focusing our resources on the versions that majority of you use. 2. Enhance the security of Knox products by restricting the supported versions to recent ones that have valid security patches from OS or hardware. Exceptions , Knox Platform for Enterprise is supported from Knox 2.4 and each feature is dependent on the specific Knox version. Knox Manage is supported from seven major Android versions (6-12) as of March 2022. To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted. You may continue to use Knox products on such devices, but the Samsung teams won't provide support for issues on those devices. For security and performance, we recommend upgrading your Android devices to meet the minimum supported version requirements. Supported versions for each Knox solution _Last updated March 22, 2023_ The following table lists the minimum supported Android version for each Knox product.
