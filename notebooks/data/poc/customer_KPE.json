Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) licenses are designed to be activated and managed from within your existing enterprise mobility management (EMM) or unified endpoint management (UEM) solution, and are also included as part of Samsung Knox Suite. There are currently two types of KPE licenses - _Standard_ and _Premium_. Standard licenses provide basic KPE features, and have typically been activated by EMM and UEM partners. Premium licenses, also known as _Commercial_ licenses, provide premium KPE features, and have typically been activated by customers. A Premium license is also required to make use of Knox Service Plugin features. However, to simplify the KPE licensing model and improve customer satisfaction, Samsung plans to retire the Standard license in the future. Samsung provides KPE Premium licenses at no cost. The Samsung Knox team recommends that EMM partners activate KPE Premium licenses for customers using Samsung devices. Customers no longer need to acquire their own KPE licenses - instead, they can use their EMM providers' Premium license keys. Specialized KPE licenses such as Knox Dual Data-At-Rest (DualDAR) and Knox Universal Credential Management (UCM) still exist, and continue to be paid licenses. Obtain a license You can get a Knox Platform for Enterprise license in three ways: If you want to use EMM features, including Knox Service Plugin, follow these steps to get a KPE Premium license: 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. 2. On the Licenses page, click Manage license keys. 3. Click Actions > Generate Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. A new KPE license is added to your license key list: If you're an EMM partner, Samsung recommends that you generate a new KPE Premium license to ensure that your license key is the latest type. If you're a developer, get a KPE Premium license through the Knox Developer Portal. For details, see Get a license in the Knox Developer documentation. Purchase a device and software bundle from a solutions provider, independent software vendor, managed service provider, or reseller, and receive a license when your device provider includes a Knox license key with your purchase. If you received such a bundle, contact the vendor of your supported EMM or device reseller for more details. Activate a license Once you have a KPE license, you can activate it in your EMM. Your EMM may have already activated your Knox license key for you upon purchase. Contact your EMM vendor to check if you need to input the license key manually. Activate the KPE license on your EMM console. Consult your solution's documentation for details about how it has integrated KPE. For example, the following image shows the license page in Knox Manage. If you use Knox Manage, this page is where you activate your KPE license. #Activate a license without an internet connection If your enterprise is highly regulated and doesn't allow communication with external servers, you can request the paid Knox License On-Premises Server software, which handles license verification within your firewall. For more information, contact your Samsung representative or reseller, or Samsung Support. Renew a license If your KPE license is already expired or is about to expire within the next 90 days, you can now renew the license for another two years. If your KPE license expires, it will impact your existing devices and you must re-activate your devices through your EMM. KPE Premium license 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. 2. On the Licenses page, click Manage license keys. 3. Click Actions > Renew Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. 4. Select the license key you want to renew, and click Renew. KPE Standard license 1. Sign in to the Knox Developer Portal. 2. On the My license keys page, click Actions > Renew Knox Platform for Enterprise Standard license key. 3. Select the license key you want to renew, and click Renew. Validate a license key You can validate your license key as follows: 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. 2. On the Licenses page, click Manage license keys. 3. Enter your license key in the Check license keys field. FAQ How do I add more assignments to an existing KPE license key? The KPE Premium license, available at no cost, includes 10,000,000 seats, which expire 2 years from the date of activation. If you need more than 10,000,000 assignments, contact the Knox Reseller or your Samsung account representative. You do not need to obtain and activate another KPE license. Why do I lose an assignment after factory resetting a device? If you factory reset a device without first unenrolling it from your EMM, that KPE license remains consumed. By design, the assignment isn't automatically freed. If you have already wiped a device without unenrolling it from an EMM and want to restore its Knox license seat, use the device deactivation tool. For details, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox Platform for Enterprise license key. What happens to the Work container if the license expires? The Knox Workspace license expires two years after its activation date. If the license expires, access to the Work container depends on the device's Android version: Android 11 and higher - The Work container can be used, but KPE APIs can no longer be called. You won't be able to apply KPE policies until the license is reactivated. Android 10 and lower - The Work container locks, and KPE APIs can no longer be called. But the data inside the container is unaffected, and the user regains access to the container and data after the license is extended or reactivated. Some Android 10 devices may exhibit behavior similar to Android 11 devices. The following limitations apply to the container when the license expires: For any device running Android 9 and lower, and some Android 10 devices, the container will be locked and inaccessible until the license is extended or reactivated. You can't push any Knox Workspace policies to devices. All Knox Workspace policies set in the EMM tenant persist and can't be updated.",

This article provides an overview of the user agreements required by the Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) license in the course of managing an Android device. These agreements are detailed in two documents: The Knox Privacy Policy, The KPE Terms & Conditions (T&C) When a KPE license is activated on a device, the device user is presented with a consent screen for each document. Enrollment won't proceed if they don't consent to both. Over the course of the development of KPE, consent process has simplified. This article outlines the differences between each Android OS and Android device management mode. Some EMM Device Policy Controllers (DPCs) activate the KPE Standard key to enable specific features on Samsung devices. Differences between the Knox Privacy Policy and T&C consent screens The consent screens are displayed in the following contexts: Android device management mode Android version KPE T&amp;C consent screen after DPC license activation Knox Privacy Policy consent screen during enrollment Knox Privacy Policy consent screen after third-party app license activation Fully-managed device, work profile on a company-owned device, or fully-managed device with a work profile (deprecated in Android 11) 10 and lower Always displayed Always displayed Displayed only if neither the Device Owner nor the Profile Owner activated the license 11 and 12 Always displayed Always displayed Always displayed (depending on device model) Android 11 &mdash; Before May 2022 release Android 12 &mdash; Before March 2022 release Always displayed Always displayed Not displayed (depending on device model) Android 11 &mdash; After May 2022 release Android 12 &mdash; After March 2022 release 13 and higher Not displayed Always displayed Not displayed &mdash; Device user already accepted the Knox Privacy Policy during enrollment Device Administrator mode (deprecated in Android 9) All Not applicable Not applicable Always displayed Independent Service Vendors All Not applicable Not applicable Always displayed Knox Privacy Policy and T&C consent screens The following images demonstrate the Knox Privacy Policy and T&C consent screens based on the license activation cases: KPE T&C consent screen after DPC license activation Knox Privacy Policy consent screens during enrollment Knox Privacy Policy consent screens after third-party app license activation See also , For more information about Knox Platform for Enterprise license types and permissions, refer to the Knox SDK license overview.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Apply basic policies. Before setting any policies, ensure you have met the following prerequisites. Refer to your UEM documentation for instructions on how to complete these steps. 1. Your devices are set up in either a DO or PO deployment mode. 2. You have set up a Managed Google Play store. 3. You have added KSP as an approved app. Set a standard policy #Device Owner (DO) This example demonstrates how to use a device-wide (DO) policy that requires a fingerprint as the minimum password strength. This configuration is applied to the entire device. You can repeat this sequence of steps for any policy that falls under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Device Wide Policy Controls. 2. Under Password policy turn on Enable password policy controls with KSP. 3. Under Biometric authentication turn on Enable fingerprint authentication. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 5. Your policies are now applied. #Profile Owner (PO) This example demonstrates how to use a profile-wide policy that disables the Android Allow Share Via feature. The particular policies used in this section require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. You can repeat this step sequence for any policy under the Work profile policies (Profile Owner) category. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Work profile policies (Profile Owner) category, turn on Enable work profile policy controls. 2. Under Device Restrictions turn on Enable device restriction controls. 3. If required, enter your Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium License Key. If your UEM natively supports Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license activation, you don't need to fill out this field. Check with your UEM for more information. 4. Disable Allow Share Via option. 5. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 6. Your policies are now applied. Here is an example of a success message and an error message. The error message occurs if you try to apply a Premium policy to a device without first activating a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. Set multiple policy parameters Some policies allow you to select more than one option as a parameter. With these policies, you can individually select which parameters to enable or disable. In some cases, you may need to deselect policy parameters that you do not want to apply. For example, we set the USB exception list to allow only Audio and Human Interface Device. The following image shows a policy with multiple options applied. To revoke multiple polices, simply deselect the polices you want to change and push the updated configuration profile to your devices. Set group policies Some policies are actually a subset of a larger group policy. With these policies, you must enable the group policy before you can modify any individual parameters. For example, we must first turn on Tethering controls before we can access the Allow Wi-Fi tethering and Allow Bluetooth tethering settings. The following image illustrates these settings. Target a specific app To target a specific app, you need to use the app package name in conjunction with a KSP policy. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Enable application management controls. 2. Under Application Management policies, enable Enable application management controls with KSP. 3. Under Battery optimization insert the app package name you want to target, for example, `com.samsung.email.provider`. If you want to add more than one app, enter a comma separated list of package names, for example `com.samsung.email.provider, com.samsung.android.app.notes, com.sec.android.app.voicenote`. If you need to remove an app from a previously applied policy, simply remove the app package from your comma separated list and re-apply the configuration. One way to find an app's package is to search for it on Google Play in a browser. You see the app package appended to the URL in the browser, as seen in the following image. Enforce a password policy The first line of defense on a device is a strong device password. KSP offers granular controls for IT admins to enforce the use of a strong password as well as allow or block other authentication methods on a device. For example, let's turn off biometric authentication methods for devices as well as enforce a specific password policy. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, next to Password Policy, click Configure. 2. On the Password Policy page that opens, set the Enable password policy controls with KSP field to True. 3. Next to the Biometric authentication field, click Configure. 4. On the Biometric authentication page that opens, set all fields to False. Doing so turns off all biometric authentication methods for these devices. Return to the Password policy page. 5. Next to the Password Change field, click Configure. 6. On the page that opens, set the Enforce password change field to True. When you set the Enforce password change field to True, the device user is forced to set up a password - if one was not already set up - or change the password, if a password was previously set on the device. 7. In the Password enforcement timeout field, set a value for the number of minutes up to which the user can cancel or delay the password change. We recommend setting a low value to enforce a password change in a timely fashion. Return to the Password policy page. 8. Next to the Password Restrictions field, click Configure. 9. In the Maximum character sequence length field, set the maximum length of an alphabetic sequence that is allowed for a password. 10. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. Your policy is now updated. Revoke a policy Revoking a policy is simple. All you need to do is find the policy you previously enabled and toggle it back off. For example, let's turn Wi-Fi back on from our previous example. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Device Wide Policy Controls. 2. Find the previous policy you disabled, for example Allow Wi-Fi. 3. Turn Allow Wi-Fi back on. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 5. Your policy is now updated. #Revoke a group of policies You can also revoke an entire group of polices if you turn off the respective group control flag. For example, if you turn off Enable device restriction controls, then all device restrictions are revoked. In addition, if a policy that is related to a configuration is disabled, all the configuration is revoked. For example, if Customize DeX Experience is turned off , then all settings applied from the DeX customization profile are revoked. Test and debug policies To test your polices, you use a feature called Debug mode. 1. Turn on Debug mode. 2. Set or update the policies you need. 3. Push the policies to a device. 4. Check the KSP app for debug information. Tips on successful KSP deployments 1. Deploy payloads gradually. 2. Add only a small number of policy changes at a time. Push , Test , Ensure success 3. Disable debug mode in production after testing. 4. Assign unique profile names in KSP. Settings can be configured in 2 main areas - the Device wide policies (DO and WP-C) and the Work profile policies (PO). The sections below these DO and PO configurations are sub sections of the policy, and usually need to be enabled in the DO or PO prior to being configured in the policy. Inside of each section of the policy, there are typically switches that turn on individual settings. During configuration, make sure not to navigate back in your web browser, or you will lose your progress. If the EMM console splits into different sections, use the navigation controls inside the EMM to navigate. Navigation specifics vary based on your EMM.",

Knox Service Plugin is an app that lets you use Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) features to administer, configure, and secure Samsung devices, as soon as the features are available through a Knox Platform for Enterprise release. As an IT admin, you are able to use the latest Knox features on the day they are launched, instead of needing to develop your own solution using the Samsung Knox SDK, or waiting for your UEM provider to integrate the features. Why use Knox Service Plugin? Here's a simple example to explain how Knox Service Plugin can help you: Let's say that Knox Platform for Enterprise introduces the capability for Samsung devices to translate speech to any language in real time. James, an IT admin for his global organization, thinks that would be a very useful feature to deploy to his team's devices, but his team doesn't include a software developer to make use of the Knox SDK to incorporate the feature. James contacts a developer at his UEM provider, Leonard, to ask when the new feature might be integrated into the UEM's console. Leonard tells James that the new feature won't be included in their UEM console for many months. Undeterred, James remembers that he doesn't need to wait for Leonard to implement the new feature. Instead, he can add the Knox Service Plugin app to his UEM. With the plugin installed, new features introduced in Knox Platform for Enterprise are available in his UEM console the same day, and James can enable the translation feature on his team's devices right away. Benefits of using Knox Service Plugin Knox Service Plugin lets IT admins use Knox Platform for Enterprise features as soon as they're available. Knox Platform for Enterprise brings defense-grade security on the most popular consumer devices across all enterprises. It provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features in Android. Knox is the cornerstone of a strong mobile security strategy supporting a wide variety of Samsung devices. Knox Service Plugin provides the following benefits: Helps enterprise customers deploy existing and new Knox features to their devices almost instantly after features are commercially launched. Leverages the UEM's framework and UI to offer enterprise customers better control over distribution and configuration of Knox Platform for Enterprise features.

Your UEM should have configuration settings similar to Intent for Key press and Intent for Key release. The two relevant button intents are preloaded by default, but you can change their names: com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.SIDE_PRESS com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.SIDE_RELEASE , Only use the long press intent. The short press intent may turn the device screen off or on. Press corresponds to key down, and release corresponds to key up. 5. Configure the policy for the side key menu item: 1. In your UEM, add a new setting menu item, for example, using a configuration option such as Configure a setting menu item. 2. Name this new menu item. For example, Side key > Press and hold. 3. Set the value for this setting to 0. 4. If possible, make sure to disable the device user's ability to modify the setting.",

Device key mapping can be supported using either a KPE Premium, Knox Suite, or Knox Platform for Customization (KPC) license. KPC is a light version of KPE focusing on customization capabilities. Keep in mind, there is a precedence amongst key mapping settings that can make using them together problematic. For tips on setting key mapping controls collectively, go to: Key mapping considerations. For information on integrating a hardware key re-mapping configuration directly with the Samsung Knox SDK, go to: Hardware key re-mapping. For general information on device key mapping, go to Device key mapping overview. For information on device key mapping for non-rugged devices, go to Device key mapping for non-rugged devices. Set the Enable Key Mapping Controls value to True to utilize a group of controls to map device key configurations for a specified application. This setting must be set to True to utilize the options and controls in this key mapping section. Setting this value to False restricts hardware key mapping capabilities. The following hardware key mapping options are available: Provide the Package Name \\ of the application receiving the customized key mapping configuration. Once the package name is defined, refer to the following key mapping options: Top_Key_Short_Press , Top_Key_Long_Press , XCover_Key_Short_Press , XCover_Key_Long_Press , Side_Key_Double_Press , Set the Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams value to True to enable key mapping support to pass an intent for a Microsoft TEAMs application package. Set the XCover/Active key mapping for specific application value to True to enable key mapping for a specific hardware press action and application package. Define the Package Name of the application (.apk) receiving the XCover/Active key mapping actions. Enable Samsung Intent to ignore any custom intent definitions for key press and key release defined below. For Intent for Key press, specify the name of the Android intent used to handle the key press event. For Intent for Key release, specify the name of the Android intent used to handle the key release event. Set the Top key mapping for specific application value to True to enable key mapping for a specific hardware press action and application package. Define the Package Name of the application (.apk) receiving the Top key mapping actions. Enable Samsung Intent to ignore any custom intent definitions for key press and key release defined below.

For example, you could press the side key on a non-rugged device to launch a push-to-talk (PTT) app, or press the top key on a rugged device to launch a camera or navigation app. Device key mapping for non-rugged devices ##Supported devices , Non-rugged devices running Android 12 and higher. Non-rugged devices that receive future Android 12 maintenance releases. These are some of the most popular Galaxy devices that are supported: Series Model series Samsung Galaxy S Samsung Galaxy S22 series Samsung Galaxy S21 series Samsung Galaxy S20 series Samsung Galaxy S10 series Samsung Galaxy A Samsung Galaxy A53 series Samsung Galaxy A52 series Samsung Galaxy A33 series Samsung Galaxy A32 series Samsung Galaxy Tab Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 series Samsung Galaxy Note Samsung Galaxy Note20 series Samsung Galaxy Note10 series ##Licenses , A free Knox license key is required to use this functionality, but license activation isn't required to be built into the partners' app. Knox Service Plugin (KSP) handles the license activation on behalf of partners. A KSP policy needs to be set up in your unified endpoint management solution (UEM). All major UEMs are compatible. Partners can retrieve Knox licenses through our Knox Partner Program or a request from their Samsung representative. ##UEM and KSP (Knox Service Plugin) , A UEM and Android Enterprise are required to use KSP. For devices where the power key is mapped to Bixby by default, you might need a UEM policy that disables Bixby. Depending on the device, the screen might switch on and off when the Home key is pressed. The partners' app must take this into account and work around the issue. #Independent software vendor (ISV) partners If you're an ISV partner, see Knox Service Plugin managed side key mapping for non-rugged devices for detailed information about setting up side key mapping on non-rugged devices. #IT admins If you're an IT admin looking for information on how to map keys on non-rugged devices, go to Device key mapping for non-rugged devices.

Use of these policies requires a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Enable DeX The process to enable DeX is simple and only requires you to turn on a few policies as follows: 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. To disable DeX, simply turn off Allow DeX connection, as shown in the previous example. Enable DeX with basic customization This example shows you how to enable DeX so it auto-launches and sets a specific screen timeout. Note that all DeX customization policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under DeX customization profile, enable Auto-start DeX on HDMI connection. 5.

Select a single resolution value for the connected display. Unselected display options will be greyed out and unavailable. Keep in mind, changing the resolution makes displayed windows, text and other items appear small or larger. Options include, WQHD (2560 x 1440), FHD (1920 x 1080) _recommended setting_, HD+ (1600 x 900), WQXGA (2560 x 1600), WUXGA (1920 x 1200), or UWQHD (3440 x 1440). Select Done to commit the selected display setting. If the display resolution provided is not supported, then FHD (1920 x 1080) is selected by default and non-supported resolutions are greyed out in the DeX Display resolution screen. Industry example This example configures a tablet in DeX mode, so a bank employee can use it to help customers with day to day operations. For example opening a new account or checking account balances. In this use case, DeX is used as a dedicated employee work station and the bank can slowly phase out older, single-purpose computer terminals. These instructions do not apply to any specific UEM. Refer to your UEM documentation for specific instructions on menu structure and navigation. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under DeX Policy, turn on Enable DeX policy controls. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Customize DeX Experience. 5. Set the DeX profile name to an appropriate value. For example, the following image shows a profile called Bank Terminal. 6. Under DeX customization profile, type the name of the DeX Profile you set in the previous step. In this example, it is Bank Terminal 7. Under DeX customization profile, enable DeX Auto Start on HDMI connection This setting minimizes potential troubleshooting for employees and can reduce IT overhead. If a device is unplugged, setting up the bank terminal again is as simple as plugging the device back in to an HDMI cable. 8. Under DeX customization profile, enable Disable buttons on the DeX panel. Select the buttons you want to disable. For example, selecting Exit DeX button prevents users from exiting the bank terminal and using the device for other purposes. 9. Under DeX customization profile, turn on Skip overscan detection screen. The overscan screen is a setting that automatically tries to optimize the UI according to the monitor you are using. This setting is unnecessary for this use-case. 10. Under DeX customization profile, enable Add application shortcuts on DeX. You can now add relevant bank services that employees need to use to the DeX homescreen. To do add apps, list the app packages in the App package name dialog. 11. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 12. Once configured and pushed to a device, DeX auto launches with your company profile and policies applied. DeX Customization features do not always return errors in debug mode. This omission can happen if your device may not have the correct OS or DeX version installed.

Once the updates have been completed, click OK. Updated password settings are saved and deployed to devices based on the deployment schedule. Set the Enable password policy controls with KSP value to True to permit the management of password policies on a device. Enable this option before changing any of the device's password settings. If this option is not set to True, then any password or user authentication settings are ignored. Refer to the following Biometric authentication options to use personal traits (fingerprints, iris, and facial recognition) as device user authenticators. Consider biometric authenticators as an alternative to traditional passwords that are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing attempts and duplication. Enable fingerprint authentication - Set this value to True to permit the use of fingerprint recognition as a device user authenticator. Enable Iris authentication - Set this value to True to permit the use of an iris as a device user authenticator. Iris scanning measures the unique patterns in the human iris (the colored circles in the eye). The iris scanner then creates a digital representation of the data and store it in a database for potential use as a user authenticator. Enable Face recognition - Set this value to True to utilize a digital image of a device user's face as an authenticator. An authentication request matches the user's facial image with the image stored in the database before device access is granted. If a lock is set in DO and it is using P/P/P authentication, the user should not be able to use facial authentication in PO. Set the Enable multifactor authentication value to True to enable multifactor authentication (2FA), enforcing a device unlock only after two successful authentication methods are provided. If enabling multifactor authentication, one authentication method must be biometric (fingerprint, iris, or face), and the other must be a lock screen method (PIN, password, or pattern). Multifactor authentication is only supported on Knox 3.2.1 and above devices. Keep in mind, the incorrect use of multifactor authentication with \"One lock\" and a biometric policy could result in a locked device requiring qualified support assistance to unlock. Refer to the following Password change options to enforce how device users set their login password and the interval it is changed: Set the Enforce Password Change value to True to force the user to change their password the next time they login to their device. If no password has been set, use this option to force the user to create a password. Verify existing password enforcement conditions before setting this value to True to ensure password enforcement changes do not occur at an unexpected time. If unsure, set this value to False. Configure a Password Enforcement timeout \\ to define the maximum number of minutes a device user can wait to cancel or delay a password change. Refer to the following Policy Restriction settings to manage various password complexity characteristics: Set the Maximum Character Sequence Length \\ to define the maximum alphanumeric character sequence permitted for a device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on alphanumeric sequence length. Set the Maximum Numeric Sequence Length \\ to specify the maximum numeric sequence length permitted for a device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on numeric sequence length. Set the Minimum Password Length \\ to specify the minimum number of characters permitted for the device password. The larger the number, the greater potential strength of the device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction. Define the Allowed Time for User Activity before Device Locks to set the maximum number of milliseconds \\ for user activity before the device will lock. A value of zero (0) means no activity restrictions are in place. Set the Maximum Failed Password Attempts to Wipe Data to define the number of failed password attempts \\ allowed before the data on the device is wiped and rendered unavailable. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on the number of failed login attempts. Keep in mind, the string provided via the API takes effect immediately, with no chance to revert the data once the defined number of password attempts is exceeded. Enter the Maximum Failed Password Attempts to Disable Work Profile to set the number of failed password attempts \\ before the work profile and device itself are disabled. Once disabled, the device user is unable to restore the device with the password, and an administrator must re-enable the device. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on the number of failed login attempts. Refer to the Define Password Quality value to select the level of complexity required when setting a device's work profile password. From No Password to Complex Password (letter, numeric and alphanumeric characters required). A Numeric Complex password must include numeric characters with no repeating or ordered integers.

KSP provides a group of policies to manage universal authentication credentials in both external and internal device storage, for example, a smartcard, micro SD card, or embedded Secure Element. Depending upon your network and security needs, you can enable or disable UCM policies as well as configure advanced settings for your UCM plugins. Before you can enable UCM plugins for your devices, you must create and configure at least one UCM configuration policy. 1. Create UCM configuration policy The following example describes the process to create a new UCM configuration policy, called Screen lock, that dictates how the UCM plugin restricts access to specific apps on the target device when the device is locked. 1. In your UEM console, open the Device Configuration Profile that is associated with your target devices > click the appropriate option to edit the profile. 2. On the policy settings homepage, next to UCM plugin configurations, click Configure. The page refreshes to show the UCM plugin configurations menu item on the left hand navigation menu. 3. On the refreshed navigation menu, click UCM plugin configurations > Add setting. The UCM plugin configuration page opens to show a set of fields that help you create and customize your UCM plugin. 4. On the UCM plugin configuration page, do as follows: 1. In the Name of UCM plugin configuration field, enter Screen lock. Always choose a name that highlights the main feature or use of the UCM plugin configuration that you are setting up. You can then reference this name in KSP to apply these settings to the target device. 2. In the Package name of UCM plugin application field, enter the package name for your UCM vendor's application. Sample format is `com.mycompany.ucm.plugin`. Refer to the UCM vendor application's Google Play Store page for the correct package name. 3. In the Credential usage list, select Screen lock. 4. If your UCM vendor's plugin supports PIN caching, in the Pin properties area > in the PIN timeout type list > select Same as screen lock. The UCM plugin now requires re-authentication whenever the screen locks. 5. In the Application access controls area > Type of access restrictions list > select Unrestricted access. 6. In the Access control when device or workspace is locked area > Lock credential storage when device or workspace is locked list > click True. 7. In the List of apps allowed to access credential storage when locked field, enter the package names - in a comma-separated list - to allow specific apps to access UCM credential storage when the device is locked. 8. List of certificates to install on this credential storage after configuration. 5. Click OK to save this new UCM configuration. This UCM configuration restricts all apps' access to UCM credential storage, with the exception of specific apps, when the device is locked. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for each type of UCM configuration policy you want to create in your Device Configuration Profile. 2. Use an existing UCM configuration policy The following example shows you how to use the Screen lock UCM configuration policy that you created earlier to automatically secure target devices in the High security devices device group when the screen is locked. 1. After you've created the Screen lock UCM configuration policy in your chosen Device Configuration Policy, go to Groups > All groups. 2. On the All groups page, confirm that the High security devices device group exists. Refer to your UEM console's help documentation for information on creating a new or editing an existing device group. 3. Go to the Device Configuration Policy that contains the Screen lock UCM configuration policy > click Assignments > Include tab. 4. On the Include page, in the Assign to list, select High security devices > click Save. 5. Depending upon the settings you've chosen for deploying Device Configuration Policy changes, the new UCM Configuration Policy is deployed on the devices in the High security devices group.",

            "content": "VPN policies. Configuring and applying VPN policies with KSP is a two step process: To use VPN features on Samsung One UI Core devices, you are required to add the KSP package name `com.samsung.android.knox.kpu` to the certificate allow list using the allow applications to read private keys without alerting user feature in the Certificate Management Policies section. VPN policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. Set up the VPN configuration profile - Choose the VPN settings and policies to suit your organization. These settings are saved as a profile you can reuse in later configurations, such as setting up a DO or PO profile. 2. Create the VPN policy - The VPN Policy uses settings from the VPN configuration profile created in the previous step. This VPN policy allows you to specify other rules, such as which apps should use this VPN. The following example shows you how to configure a per app VPN on a Device Owner (DO) device. Configure VPN profile 1. Under VPN profiles, VPN Profile, enter a profile name. For example, `VPN_Knox`. 2. Under VPN profiles, Vendor, choose the type of VPN you want to use. For this example, we select Knox built-in, which uses the Android VPN Management for Knox VPN. 3. Under Host, list your server host IP, for example, `52.3.256.0`. 4. Leave all other values as default. 5. In your UEM, save the profile. Configure VPN Vendor parameters Now that you have created a VPN profile, you can set up the parameters such as the identifier and pre-shared key. Following the previous example, continue to configure Android VPN Management for Knox VPN. 1. Under Parameters for Knox built-in VPN, Authentication type select `ipsec_ike2_rsa.` 2. Under User certificate alias, enter your certificate name. For example: `md_user.pfx`. 3. Under CA certificate alias, enter your certificate name. For example: `vpn_cal.pfx`. 4. Leave all other values as default. 5. In your UEM, save the profile. If you are using a different VPN, such as Pulse Secure or Cisco AnyConnect, these values may differ. The mandatory parameters you need to set depend on your network configuration. Contact your Network Administrator to find out which fields to use and with what values. Enable VPN policy Now that you have created and configured a profile, configure a policy and push it to a target device. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under VPN policy, turn on Enable VPN controls. 3. Under VPN type, choose Selected Apps (Per-App). Currently, KSP does not support per-app the VPN mode for Net Motion VPN. 4. Under Manage list of apps that use VPN, add the package names of the apps you want to route through the VPN. For example, `com.samsung.email.provider`. If you do not enter any app packages, the VPN applies to all apps by default. 5. Enter the Name of VPN profile to use, for this example we use our Android VPN Management for Knox profile `VPN_Knox`. 6. Leave all the other VPN values as set by default. 7. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. Within the VPN policy, optionally enable USB tethering over VPN so an allow listed USB device can access and share resources with a peer device. Admins can ensure there is security-based certification available so only a designated organization, or user, can use VPN tethering with allowed devices. However, VPN tethering will only work when the following conditions are met: An IT admin must allow this feature from their UEM console for a target device to receive the tethering feature. A user must enable VPN tethering on their device. The laptop or tablet being connected must have been previously allow listed by the IT admin. The maximum number of VPN connections does not exceed 2. USB tethering over VPN is only supported on Knox 3.5 and above devices. A wrong VPN configuration can disconnect your device or work profile from the network, and in some cases render it unrecoverable. To avoid this issue, Samsung recommends keeping the following applications out of the VPN configuration: UEM Agent package - Check with your UEM for details. KSP package - `com.samsung.android.knox.kpu`, Google services - `com.android.vending, com.google.android.gms` Use the Manage list of apps that can bypass VPN setting to list theses packages.",

Samsung devices that support Knox and run Android 9 or higher. 2. A Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solution that supports Android Enterprise deployments and is compatible with KSP. 3. A valid Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) license for each of the devices managed with KSP. For more information about Knox licenses, see Knox Platform for Enterprise licenses. 4. You must set up your devices in one of the supported Android Enterprise deployments, as described in the following section. Supported deployments The first step to deploy a KSP policy is to create a DO or PO profile on your device. Without choosing one or the other, policies do not work and an error message is thrown. In an enterprise deployment, Google provides three modes of Android Enterprise, fully managed (DO), work profile (PO), and fully managed with a work profile. Work Profile - Helps admins manage the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) use case, where a device user owns the device and uses it both personally and for work. The agent sits inside the container area as Profile Owner (PO) to separate work apps from personal apps. IT admins can control the work area only, and have no visibility over or access to the personal area. Managed Device - Also known as Company Owned, Business Only (COBO); helps admins manage devices that are owned by the enterprise. When a device is enrolled as a Managed Device, IT admins have full control over the device. The agent sits as Device Owner (DO) of the device. Work Profile on Company Owned Devices - Also known as Corporate Owned, Managed Profile (COMP) on Android 10, and WP-C (starting Android 11+) are company-owned devices that are personally enabled, with a container that is managed by PO. This deployment type targets enterprise-owned devices that require a separation of work and personal data. Employees can use these devices for either work or personal purposes. For more information, refer to Work profile enhancements for company-owned devices. #KSP works with the following Android Enterprise deployment modes: Android 9.0, 10.0 - Fully managed device - Device Owner (DO), Work Profile - Profile Owner (PO), fully managed device with a Work Profile, and Android dedicated devices (COSU) (Corporate-Owned Single Use) mode. Android 11 and higher - Fully managed device - Device Owner (DO), Work Profile on personally owned devices (PO), Work Profile on company-owned devices (WP-C), and Android dedicated devices (COSU). Refer to your respective EMM configuration guide for information on provisioning dedicated devices (COSU). Supported features Your deployment must use policy configurations that Knox Service Plugin supports. Knox Service Plugin inherits its policies from the Knox Platform for Enterprise framework. These policies can be either standard or premium features. Premium features require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Supported UEMs You need a UEM that supports Android Enterprise based deployments, device management APIs, and complies with the OEMConfig specification. Check with your UEM vendor to confirm which version of the UEM console you need to use with Knox Service Plugin. Some UEMs offer more than one console, and some consoles may not support Knox Service Plugin. For information about configuring UEMs, see Set up with a UEM. All UEM partners continue to support KPE through their console. Customers need to use KSP only if their UEM solution provider does not support a Knox feature they plan to use.

This document is intended for: System architects - Understand how Knox Service Plugin works, and how you can use it to customize your deployment of Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE). IT admins - Configure the options available to Knox Platform for Enterprise deployments using Knox Service Plugin. How Knox Service Plugin works Knox Service Plugin is built on top of Android's standard called OEMConfig. OEMConfig is a feature that lets you create and remotely push configurations to apps through an XML schema file that is hosted in an app on Google Play. This architecture means that any UEM that complies with the OEMConfig standard can support Knox Service Plugin. Here is an overview of how Knox Service Plugin works. 1. App developers implement logic to support managed configurations in their apps. They use an XML schema file to define which app settings IT admins can remotely configure in their Android app. This schema is linked to the app's manifest file. After each update, app developers push their app to Managed Google Play. 2. UEM developers pull the managed configuration schemas from apps on Managed Google Play. UEM consoles then use these XML schemas to allow IT admins to specify how they want to configure app settings. After the IT admin saves their configuration, the UEM pushes the configuration to Managed Google Play. 3. Once an app configuration is updated and pushed to Managed Google Play, the app is updated on all applicable devices to reflect the new configuration. The following image is an example of a Knox Service Plugin policy in a UEM console. The implementation, appearance, and menu structure of how these policies look varies depending upon your UEM and its console. For UEM-specific help, refer to your UEM vendor's documentation. Deployment process The Knox Service Plugin deployment process is as follows: 1. Samsung publishes the latest Knox Service Plugin app to Google Play. 2. IT admins use their compatible UEM console - that supports a managed Google Play store - to search for Knox Service Plugin. For a list of UEM partners that support Knox Service Plugin, see Supported UEMs. 3. The UEM Console renders the applicable Knox features and policies using OEMConfig. 4. IT admins use the UEM\"console to set up policies in the form of managed configurations. These policies are then saved and published to any managed enterprise devices. 5. When a user's device is being provisioned, the UEM invokes the managed Google Play Store, which in turn installs Knox Service Plugin and pushes the managed configuration to the device. 6. After installation is complete, Knox Service Plugin runs in the background on the device. Knox Service Plugin applies the relevant Knox policies and returns the result of the configuration process using Google's Feedback SDK. 7. IT admins can view any configuration failures and associated error messages on the UEM Console, provided the UEM is equipped to handle the result that KSP generates and sends back using the feedback SDK.",

The following image shows the high level categories of policies and common configurations. It has four main components: 1. Basic elements - General operational controls for KSP. For example, turn on debug mode or input a KPE license key. 2. Device-wide policies section - Device Owner (DO) policy controls. These are of global scope. 3. Work profile policies section - Profile Owner (PO) policy controls. These apply to only the . 4. Configurations - Specific configuration properties that are used in conjunction with policy controls. For example, VPN profile settings, APN settings, or DeX customization settings. These can be used on either device-wide policies or work profile policies. Schema breakdown #Common configurations Each version of Knox Service Plugin includes a few common options. The features available within these options depend upon your Knox Service Plugin deployment mode, Knox Platform for Enterprise license status - whether you have a Standard or a Premium license - as well as the features available on your UEM console. Device key mapping can be supported using either a KPE Premium, Knox Suite*, or Knox Platform for Customization (KPC) license. \\* For information on Knox Suite, go to: Knox Suite. KPC is a light version of KPE focusing on customization capabilities. These common options are as follows: 1. Profile name - A unique nickname you provide for a set of policy configurations. You can create many different profile names for various sets of configurations. Later, you can use the name for tracking and debugging purposes. We recommend using a name less than 50 characters in length, for example, `MyEnterprise Profile`. 2. KPE Premium License key - This is useful for consoles that do not have Knox Premium License activation built in as a native feature. When this field is used, KSP can activate the license for you when you push the configuration. If your UEM console has already activated a Knox Premium License on your device, there is no need to activate a license using this field. The following image is an example of this field. You only need to input a license if you are using a premium policy. If you do not provide a license key and use a premium policy - or the key provided does not have necessary privileges - the KSP policy fails and produces an error message. 3. Debug modes - When you turn on debug mode, you can view policy results and errors on the device through an app menu. We recommend enabling this mode only during test phases and not during final deployment. If you run into any KSP deployment issues, check this box to enable debug mode and try to perform the action again. You can also export the message and reach out to Knox Support for help to diagnose and fix your issue. 4. DO and PO policies - Depending upon your deployment mode, you need to enable device-wide or Work profile-wide policy controls. Do as follows: Device-wide policies - To enable or disable device-wide policies, use the Enable device policy controls field. Enable this option before using any of the Device-wide policies. If this option is disabled, KSP does not apply any policies in default user (User 0). Work profile-wide policies - To enable or disable Work profile-wide policies, use the Enable work profile policy controls field. Enable this option before using any of the Device-wide policies. If this setting is disabled, KSP does not apply any policy changes inside the Work Profile. #Group policy control flag Every group has a control that enables or disables that policy group. By default every policy group is disabled. You must enable this control before setting any policy in the group. For example, before using any policy in the device-wide policy section, turn on the Enable device-wide policies control first. Further more, to use any device restrictions within the device-wide policy section, turn on Enable device restriction controls and then activate individual policies, such as Allow microphone, Allow Wi-Fi and so on. Control groups are mandatory. Incorrect control group settings or deleting them from input configuration causes KSP to revoke policies or not process policies in that group. The following image illustrates a control group. #Profile Configurations You can save a group of configurations using a Profile Name. Once you save a group of configurations, you can reuse these configurations for as many deployments as you need. For example, in the following image, we have set the DeX profile name as `DeX profile 1`. Any configurations set are saved under the name `DeX profile 1`. When setting policies later, you can reference `DeX profile 1` to quickly set up devices with your saved configurations. Recommended practices , Auto-install - Turn this feature on if your UEM supports it. This feature ensures all devices install KSP automatically when prompted. Auto-update - Turn this feature on if your UEM supports it. This feature ensures that the KSP app is up to date on deployed devices. KSP is designed to be backward compatible. For example, a newer version of the app can handle older schema data, but older app versions can't handle new schema data. Native console policies - Use your UEM console for any policy that is supported natively and use KSP to bridge any gaps. Test in small batches - Always test your KSP schema changes with a limited set of devices, debug the issues (if any) by enabling debug mode, then roll out to wider deployment. Special cases #List applications Some fields allow you to specify more than one app to target. For example: when you select apps to allowlist for a proxy. To list out apps, use a comma-separated list of packages. For example `com.samsung.android.email.provider, com.sec.android.app.sbrowser`. To find a package name, look at the Google Play store URL or contact the app vendor. #Uploading files Some Knox policies, such as DeX customization, require you to provide bulk data, such as an image file. However, OEMConfig specifications do not currently support file upload. If you need to upload a file you can use one of the following two methods: Web URL - Upload the file to a cloud server and provide the web URL as an input string to KSP. Ensure that the URL is publicly accessible. Some UEMs have a limitation on the number of characters you can enter in a string field. In such cases, you cannot use this approach to upload files. Push the image file to the local storage - Use the UEM console to push the image file to the local storage on the device and provide the file path on the device as the input string to KSP. Contact your UEM vendor to find out if they support this feature. Push the image to your device before you install KSP and it attempts to apply any policies to the device.",

            "content": "STIG configurations. This section describes the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) configurations and guidelines that devices need to meet in government and defense agencies. Devices that meet these configurations ensure the maximum protection for sensitive and confidential data as well as improve the security of information systems. As compliance with STIG requires the application of a wide range of configurations, Knox Service Plugin (KSP) attempts to fulfill a set of configurations that the UEM does not support natively. Policies supported by Android Enterprise are not supported by KSP. Overview The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration standards and technical guidance to lock down Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance (IA) enabled devices, information systems, and software that might otherwise become vulnerable to malicious computer attacks. The STIGs are created by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in collaboration with device vendors. Samsung works with DISA to produce a STIG with the specific configuration and technical guidance that defines how organizations can deploy Samsung devices with a required security posture for use within the DoD. #Samsung's STIG For a list of most recently available STIGs, Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDFPPs), and Approved Product List (APL), go to: https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/knox-certifications. The Samsung Android STIGs covers both Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO), and the fully managed device with a work profile use cases. UEMs can deploy these use cases in one of two ways: KPE (AE) - Knox Platform for Enterprise with Android Enterprise, current deployment model , KPE (Legacy) - previous deployment model, which is marked for deprecation DISA recommends that DoD mobile service providers support KPE (AE) deployments to the maximum extent possible. The KPE\"(AE) deployment model complies with DISA's requirements using a UEM that supports AE policies, as well as the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) for additional KPE specific policies necessary for compliance. KSP can configure KPE specific policies for KPE (AE) deployments. KSP does not support KPE (Legacy) based deployments. Please note, UEMs may support KPE specific policies natively, in such case IT Admin may use either UEM or KSP to apply such policies. STIG requirements #Company Owned Business Only (COBO) Fully Managed Devices - also known as Company Owned Business Only (COBO) - are devices owned by the company. Such devices are set up to give IT admins control over an extended range of device settings and additional policy controls. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully\"managed device, go to: STIG compliance for a fully managed device. Before devices are considered STIG-compliant, these devices must meet the following prerequisites: The Samsung Android device must be one of those listed on the APL , The device must be enrolled in the UEM as a fully Managed device , Managed Google Play must be configured , Using managed Google Play, the UEM Administrator must install KSP on the device , A free KPE Premium License must be activated either within the UEM console, or KSP , The UEM administrator must apply the policies listed in the COBO KPE(AE) configuration table , The STIG configuration must match the version of Android OS installed on the device , The COBO KPE(AE) configuration table document contains only one table, \"Table 1: COBO configuration policy rules for Device-Wide Work Environment\" which contains policies that must be applied to the fully managed device , AE policies must be applied using the UEM console , KPE policies must be applied using KSP managed configuration , Appropriate STIG\"policies are applied to the device. For information on applying COBO-specific STIG policies, go to: STIG compliance for COBO devices. #Fully managed device with a work profile Fully managed work profile devices allow work apps and data to be stored in a separate, self-contained space within a device. An employee can continue to use their device as normal; all their personal apps and data remain on the device's primary profile. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully\"managed device with a work profile, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile. Before devices are considered STIG-compliant, these devices must meet the following pre-requisites: The Samsung Android device must be one of those listed on the APL , The device must be enrolled in the UEM as a fully managed device with managed Profile , Managed Google Play must be configured (in the managed Profile) , The UEM Administrator must install two instances of KSP: 1. Using the UEM console, the UEM Administrator must install KSP as a private or internal app within the \"personal\" side of the managed device 2. Using managed Google Play, the UEM Administrator must install KSP within the managed Profile Ensure that the KSP version installed within the Personal profile of the managed device is the same or higher than the KSP version installed within the Managed Work profile. KPE Premium License is activated within the UEM console or using KSP in the managed Work profile. The fully managed device with a work profile KPE (AE) configuration document contains two tables, namely - Table 1: Configuration policy rules for Non-Work environment and Table 2: Configuration policy rules for Work environment. The UEM administrator must apply the policies listed in these two tables as follows: The STIG configuration must match the version of Android OS installed on the device , Apply policies from Table 1: Configuration policy rules for Non-Work Environment to the Personal side of the fully managed device , Apply policies from Table 2: Configuration policy rules for Work Environment the Work profile within the managed device , Apply AE policies using the UEM console. Apply KPE policies using the KSP managed configurations. Appropriate STIG\"policies are applied to the device. For information on applying specific STIG policies, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed device with a work profile. #Using the UEM and KSP to apply STIG policies STIG compliance requires devices to meet strict security requirements. While the actual labels and naming conventions for each of these policies differ for each UEM console, the restrictions that are applicable for each individual policy remain the same irrespective of the UEM used. For a detailed description of the KPE APIs required to reach STIG compliance on a Samsung Knox device, go to: Knox STIG API Table (Knox 3.x / Android 10).

To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully managed device, go to: STIG compliance for a fully managed device. To apply STIG compliance policies to COBO devices do as follows: 1. Set up COBO mode on your UEM console. 2. Implement COBO method of AE deployment on your devices. 3. Add KSP as an app in primary profile (DO). 4. Create new DO profiles with appropriate policy restrictions as described in the Configure policies section of the KSP Admin Guide. 5. In your UEM console, navigate to the Device Profiles page. The navigation method and path you need to follow to open the Device Profiles page differs for each UEM. For example, the path for Microsoft Intune is as follows: Devices Profiles & Resources Profiles. Refer to your UEM console's help documentation for detailed information about your UEM's UI. 6. On this page, click Add > Add profile. The select platform to start page opens. 7. On this page, double-click Android. The Add a New Android Profile page opens to show a left navigation menu of items you can configure for your device profile. 8. Using the items on the left navigation menu, edit the STIG compliance policies for COBO devices. See Settings for STIG compliance. Save your changes. 9. Enable audit logging as follows: 1. From the UEM console home page, go to Devices > Device Settings > Android > Intelligent Hub Settings > Samsung Knox settings. 2. Set the value of the Enable Audit Logging field to Enabled. 3.

For detailed information on configuring STIG policies using VMware Workspace ONE UEM console, see VMware AirWatch v9.x MDM STIG. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile. For information on how to configure VMware Workspace One, see VMware Workspace One and Knox Platform for Enterprise, User Guide VMware Workspace ONE UEM does not currently provide native support for all STIG policies necessary for compliance. IT admins can use KSP from within Workspace ONE to ensure compliance with STIG policies. Currently, you can create a Personal space - also known as Personal profile in Android Enterprise - on fully managed device with a work profile using VMware Workspace ONE UEM, but cannot use KSP to apply additional policies to the Personal space. This results in an inability to use KSP to enforce STIG compliance for Personal space policies. To apply STIG compliance policies: 1. Set the fully managed device with a work profile mode on your UEM console. 2. Implement the fully managed device with a work profile method of AE deployment on your devices. 3. Add KSP as an app in DO and PO. 4. Create new DO and PO profiles with appropriate policy restrictions. 5. In your UEM console, go to Devices > Profiles & Resources > Profiles.

            "content": "Debug mode. We understand that successfully deploying your policies and settings correctly is important. To help you test and deploy your configurations, Knox Service Plugin (KSP) includes a setting called Debug mode. Overview By default, KSP runs in the background and does not have a UI. Debug mode enables you to easily see policy results and errors on a device, so you can verify that your configurations are correct. When turned on, it launches an app that displays the status of policies. This app should auto-launch when it receives any new polices. We recommend you use Debug mode with a limited number of devices. You should turn it off for full deployments. Here's what debug mode looks like when opened manually on a device: The app provides a list of the polices that you have pushed, along with details about the last configuration, including: Policy title - Name of the policy. Message - Description of the policy, along with the status of the policy application. Activate Debug mode Debug mode is activated inside your UEM console, in the Knox Service Plugin configuration area. The location and appearance of the Debug mode feature in your UEM console may vary depending upon your UEM UI. Here is an example of how it may look: Once you activate debug mode within your UEM, the next time policy changes are pushed to a device, the KSP app opens on the device. For example, if you are trying to debug the Enable fingerprint authentication feature, follow these steps in your UEM: 1. Turn on the Debug mode flag. 2. Expand Device-wide policies, and set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Password Policy > Biometric authentication, configure the Enable fingerprint authentication policy. 4. Push the policies to a device. 5. Check the KSP app for debug information. If, for any reason, the app does not launch: Confirm that the device is using the latest Google Play services and Play client application. Confirm that the UEM has pushed the appropriate policies to the device. Some UEMs have a delay between the time a policy is saved on the console and when it is received by the device. You may have to open the UEM agent on the device and perform a manual refresh to receive the policy. Refer to your UEM's instructions for more information. Debug mode features You can perform the following actions when Debug mode is activated: To apply any updated policies, tap Apply Latest Policies. If the policy updates aren't applied when you tap Apply Latest Policies, try again in a few minutes. It can take a short time for updated policies to be pushed from your UEM to devices. When you first open the app, it only shows the most recent pushed configuration. Tap this configuration to display the list of configuration results. You can tap Configuration results and then tap Policies received to see the policies in JSON format. To get a log of the current configurations, tap ![](./../assets/details-3-dots.png) (Details) > Export results. Successful policies are displayed in black text. Failed policies are displayed in red text. Contact Support and provide debug files In some cases, you may want to contact Support for help with a KSP issue. If you do, you need to provide the following files for investigation: ConfigurationResults_\\.txt, ReceivedPolicies_\\.txt, dumpstate log file To obtain these files for upload: 1. After enabling debug mode as described in the previous sections, open the KSP app. 2. Tap the latest configuration. 3. Tap ![](../assets/details-3-dots.png) (Details) > Export results. 4. Tap Save to save the KSP configuration results file to your Internal storage > Download folder. 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, this time tapping Export policies received, to export and save the KSP received policies file. 6. See Dumpstate logs (phone) for instructions on saving your device's dumpstate log file. Skip steps 2 - 5 in that procedure. Save the dumpstate log file soon after your issue occurs. If too much time passes, the relevant activity might no longer be contained in the log file. 7. Upload these three files to your support ticket.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Prepare Knox for Android 11. Samsung Knox supports the new Work profile on company-owned devices introduced in Android 11. Knox policies fall into two categories based on privacy guidelines: 1. Policies that don't infringe on personal privacy and are available to the profile owner of the new work profile on company-owned device. For a complete list of these, see Knox policies in the personal profile. 2. Policies that may infringe on privacy and are not available to the profile owner of the new work profile on company-owned device. During the Android 11 upgrade from the deprecated fully managed device with a work profile to the new work profile on company-owned device: Device owner is disabled. Knox policies available in the new work profile on company-owned device and called by UEMs are silently migrated to the profile owner. The profile owner retains existing Knox permissions granted through the Knox license, even though the device owner (from User 0) is disabled. Knox polices not available in the new work profile on company-owned devices will be unset. If you are currently using the fully managed device with a work profile that's been deprecated in Android 11, review the Knox policies you are setting, ensure they are still supported in the personal profile on the new Work profile on company-owned devices. The following Knox areas are impacted by Android 11 and can result in service disruptions if not prepared properly before the Android 11 upgrade. Please read carefully and follow the recommendations. Knox Audit Log If a device owner has enabled the Knox Audit Log functionality in a fully managed device with a work profile deployment, log entries from the personal profile stored to the audit log buffer will remain as is after the Android 11 upgrade to the new Work profile on company-owned devices. To protect the device user's privacy in the new Work profile on company-owned devices, some audit log messages generated in user0 that impact end user privacy will either not be visible or be redacted. Knox Deployment App (KDA) The KDA's NFC enrollment option will no longer be available. It was built based on Android Beam which has been deprecated by Google. Knox DualDAR Existing DualDAR deployments on a fully managed device with a work profile will be auto migrated to the new Work profile on company-owned devices. For new DualDAR deployments, the use case where the second-layer encryption is provided by a third-party ISV is impacted. Going forward, Samsung will install the second-layer app instead of the UEM provider. For details, see DualDAR with work profile on company-owned devices. Knox E-FOTA Samsung will install the E-FOTA client in the personal profile once enabled by the IT admin using the Knox Deployment Program or Knox Service Plugin. This addresses the limitation that UEMs cannot directly push the E-FOTA client in the personal profile on a device. Knox firewall and domain filter The Knox firewall and domain filter APIs are permitted in the new Work profile on company-owned devices. You need to ensure that you update your implementation to manage the Knox firewall and domain filter in the personal profile, by calling APIs using a parent instance, as described in Knox SDK. Knox global proxy In the new Work profile on company-owned devices, an IT admin is not permitted to configure and manage the Knox global proxy. The Knox framework will unset the Knox global proxy policy after the Android 11 upgrade. Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) If you have a fully managed device with a work profile enrolled via KME, we recommend that you update your KME profile with the option, Let MDM choose to enroll as a Device Owner or Profile Owner: See the difference between Device Owner and Profile Owner. KME now blocks the deprecated device admin (DA)\"mode for new device enrollments. #What happens if I don't make this change? If you do not update your KME\"profile, after the Android 11 update and a factory reset, the device will be enrolled automatically as a fully managed device (device owner) because a fully managed device with a work profile is no longer supported on Android 11. Knox Manage Devices enrolled as a fully managed device with a work profile are no longer supported on Android 11, and migrate to the new Work profile on company-owned devices. Knox Manage has deprecated the Android Legacy or device admin (DA)\"mode. For more information, see: Knox Manage release notes - November 5, 2020 , Knox\"Manage support for deprecated device modes in Android 11 Knox Network Platform Analytics (NPA) In the new Work profile on company-owned devices, the IT admin is not permitted to collect netflow data via solutions such as Knox NPA. As such UEMs must do the following prior to upgrade to Android 11: Uninstall the NPA agent in the personal profile. Configure NPA inside the work profile prior to the Android 11 upgrade. #What happens if I don't make this change? The Knox framework will not remove the NPA agent or profile prior to the Android 11 upgrade because the UEM console, UEM agent, and NPA vendor will not be in sync. Thus, if you do not take any action device wide or in the personal profile, NPA will continue to work after Android 11 upgrade, however you will not be able to manage Knox NPA in the personal profile. Knox SDK UEM\"vendors using the Knox SDK to apply Knox policies to the new Work profile on company-owned devices should review Prepare Knox for Android 11 in the Developer Guide. Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) and Samsung Email In the fully managed device with a work profile deployment, if Samsung Email is installed in the personal profile then the Samsung Email app will no longer work after the auto upgrade to the new Work profile on company-owned devices in Android 11. Samsung Email leverages the Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) feature. SDP in the personal profile does not operate as soon as the device owner is disabled. You need to ensure the following: 1. Uninstall the Samsung Email app from the personal profile and install it in the work profile prior to the Android 11 upgrade. 2. Do the same for any other SDP-enabled application. #What happens if I don't make this change? If you do not uninstall Samsung Email from the personal profile, the email will not show the body of emails. The customer will need to uninstall the Samsung Email app in the personal profile. Knox Service Plugin (KSP) UEM vendors need to ensure the following before the upgrade to Android 11: 1. Do not uninstall the KSP app in a personal profile. 2. Update the KSP app to the latest version 1.2.45 or higher. After upgrading to Android 11, the Knox framework uninstalls the KSP app from the personal profile. Note also that the following Knox features are not supported by KSP in the new Work profile on company-owned devices: Enterprise billing, Certificate management, Client Certificate management (CCM), Universal Credential Manager (UCM), Network Platform Analytics (NPA) #What happens if I don't make this change? If you do not update to the latest version of the KSP\"app, policies applied by KSP will remain unless they violate privacy. KSP cannot apply policies for the device owner after the Android 11 upgrade and will result in some exceptions and unexpected behavior. The device might enter a bad state and the device will need to be factory reset. Knox VPNs In the new Work profile on company-owned devices, the IT admin is not permitted to configure and manage a VPN in the personal profile. As such, UEMs must do the following prior to upgrade to Android 11: Uninstall the VPN agent in the personal profile. If using the Android Settings VPN, delete the VPN profile in the personal profile. Configure VPNs inside work profiles prior to the Android 11 upgrade. #What happens if I don't make this change? The Knox framework will not remove the VPN agent or Settings VPN profile in the personal profile prior to Android 11 upgrade because the UEM console, UEM agent, and VPN vendor will not be in sync. Thus, if you do not take any action device wide or in the personal profile, the VPN will continue to work after the Android 11 upgrade, however you will not be able to manage the VPN in the personal profile. Note: If the VPN agent is inside the work profile, you do not need to make any changes to the VPN configuration inside the work profile. Universal Credential Manager (UCM) UCM is not supported on the new Work profile on company-owned devices. Existing UCM deployments on a fully managed device with a work profile will not be migrated to the new Work profile on company-owned devices. As such, you must do the following prior to upgrade to Android 11: In the case of UCM-ODE and UCM-Keyguard, the device must be factory reset before the Android 11 upgrade. In other cases, you must uninstall the UCM plugin client in the personal profile. #What happens if I don't make this change? The Knox UCM framework will not remove the UCM plugin client and UCM policies in the personal profile prior to the Android 11 upgrade because the UEM console, UEM agent, and UCM plugin client will not be in sync. Thus, if you do not take any action, UCM will work after Android 11 upgrade, however you will not be able to configure or manage UCM in user 0. This could lead to unexpected behavior of the device.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "DualDAR with work profile on company-owned devices. Knox DualDAR today secures enterprise data with two independent layers of encryption. All data placed inside an Android Enterprise work profile is dually encrypted. As such, Knox DualDAR is supported on both work profile only and fully managed devices with work profile configurations. In Android 11, the work profile is enhanced for company-owned devices. Existing deployments of fully managed devices with work profile are upgraded to the new work profile on company-owned devices. For more info, see Device management modes. This impacts existing customers who have deployed DualDAR on fully managed devices with work profiles and new customers who are looking to deploy DualDAR on company-owned devices. Here, we provide an overview of Android 11 migration for existing customers and new enrollments of DualDAR for new customers. Existing deployments During Android 11 FOTA deployments, a fully managed device with a work profile is migrated to the new Work profile on company-owned devices. The DualDAR work profile will remain after the Android 11 FOTA. However, as the device is no longer fully managed, the IT admin will lose some controls at the device level (or user0 side). New deployments UEM providers today have two options to support DualDAR: Deep API integration using the Knox SDK, Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) and Knox Service Plugin (KSP) Details are provided in DualDAR UEM integration. Special consideration for third-party crypto library The DualDAR architecture enables a plugin interface where a third-party ISV can provide their own second-layer encryption app. This app must be installed in user0 outside of the work profile. However, in the new work profile on company-owned device, an IT admin can no longer install an app in user0. Starting with Android 11, Samsung will install the second-layer encryption app as part of enabling DualDAR. The precise steps depends on how a UEM provider supports DualDAR. Option 1: Deep API\"integration In this option, the UEM\"provider has integrated DualDAR APIs natively. 1. The customer provides their second-layer encryption app (apk)\"to the UEM provider. 2. The UEM\"provider stores the app on the device (external storage SD card area) during provisioning. 3. Samsung then installs the app in user0. Here is how UEM\"providers use the DualDAR\"APIs to set the file path to the encryption app: ``` // Create Dual DAR with configuration bundle PersistableBundle adminExtras = new PersistableBundle(); adminExtras.putBoolean(DualDARPolicy.KEY_DUAL_DAR_CONFIG, true); adminExtras.putString(DualDARPolicy.KEY_CONFIG_CLIENT_PACKAGE, DUALDAR_CLIENT_EXAMPLE_PACKAGE_NAME); adminExtras.putString(DualDARPolicy.KEY_CONFIG_CLIENT_SIGNATURE, DUALDAR_CLIENT_EXAMPLE_PACKAGE_SHA256_SIGNATURE); // Set the file path of the app location adding \"file://\" prefix. String DUALDAR_CLIENT_PACKAGE_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION = getExternalFilesDir(null) + \"/client_example_app.apk\"; adminExtras.putString(DualDARPolicy.KEY_CONFIG_CLIENT_LOCATION, \"file://\" + DUALDAR_CLIENT_PACKAGE_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION); // Param field in admin extras bundle passed as DevicePolicyManager.EXTRA_PROVISIONING_ADMIN_EXTRAS_BUNDLE Intent intent = new Intent(); if (adminExtras !=null && adminExtras.size() > 0) // Return DevicePolicyManager.PROVISIONING_MODE_MANAGED_PROFILE in DevicePolicyManager.EXTRA_PROVISIONING_MODE as result. intent.putExtra(DevicePolicyManager.EXTRA_PROVISIONING_MODE, DevicePolicyManager.PROVISIONING_MODE_MANAGED_PROFILE); ``` Option 2: KME and KSP In this scenario, the UEM provider has not integrated DualDAR APIs. 1. The customer enables DualDAR in their KME profile, providing the URL where the third-party app is hosted. 2. During device provisioning, Samsung pulls the third-party app from the provided location and installs it in user0.",

            "content": "Device management modes. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile with work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) , Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal profile and Knox policies in the personal profile. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more information, see Device admin deprecation.",

            "content": "Separated apps. Enterprises that provide corporate-owned personally enabled devices typically need to separate official work apps from third-party business apps installed by employees, for example, , Airline apps (United, Delta, and so on), Hotel apps (Marriott, Hilton, and so on), Ride-sharing apps (Uber, Lyft, and so on) An IT admin might not be comfortable with a third-party app that needs access to contacts, email addresses, or phone numbers. There may be concerns that sensitive work data may end up on third-party servers. The third-party apps are needed for productivity, but are not fully trusted and vetted by the IT admin. In this scenario, the enterprise is wholly responsible for their corporate assets and needs full control of their devices. As described in Device management modes, Android 11 replaced the fully managed device with work profile with a new work profile on company-owned devices. The goal is to protect the privacy of personal activities on company devices, and provide IT\"admins with adequate control over the personal side of the device. For enterprises that still need full control over a device while enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers an additional option called Separated Apps. Separated Apps isolates third-party apps in sandboxed folder. The third-party apps cannot intercommunicate with work apps or access confidential work data. Keep in mind that Separated Apps does not provide the same privacy guarantees as the new work profile on company-owned devices. As such, it is not intended for personal apps and data. How it works Separated Apps are installed in a securely separate folder: An enterprise IT\"admin uses: a UEM system to install work apps on the fully managed device, for full access and control , the Knox Service Plugin to enable Separated Apps and identify the apps to install in the folder By default, the following apps are available inside the Separated Apps folder, but don't have launch icons. They can however be launched by other apps. For example, if you open an attached image in an email app, the Gallery displays the image. Google Chrome, Microsoft Office (depends on model), Samsung Calendar, Samsung Camera, Samsung Contacts, Samsung Gallery, Samsung MyFiles, Samsung Video The device user can: set up an app shortcut from the device level, to launch an app inside the Separated Apps folder. configure the following Settings inside the Separated Apps folder: apps, notifications, data usage, certificates, and keyboard and input. Set up Separated Apps 1. In your UEM console, navigate to the Knox Service Plugin. 2. Within KSP, navigate to Separated Apps policies. 3. From the Enable Separated Apps policies drop-down menu, select Enable. If you later select Disable, this removes all apps inside the Separated Apps folder. 4. For the List of Apps to Separate, provide app package names, for example, com.united.mobile.android, com.marriott.mrt, com.ubercab. Since UEM apps must be outside the Separated Apps folder, they are ignored in the app list. Adding or removing packages will update the device the next time the policy is downloaded. If the new policy conflicts with the current configuration on the device (for example, an app is installed in the group and has now been removed from the list), the change will cause the apps to be installed or uninstalled as appropriate (for example, the app in the example would be removed from the group). Ensure that the KSP package is added in the separation list when specifying the location to be Outside. Otherwise, the App separation activation would fail due to wrong location of the KSP package. 5. For the Location for Separate Apps installation, select either: Inside (default): To install the list of apps inside the Separated Apps folder. This works like an allow list, to identify an exclusive list of authorized apps, which get installed in the Separated Apps folder. Outside: To install the list of apps outside the Separated Apps folder. This works like a block list, to identify work apps like email and messaging, which must get installed at the device level and not inside the Separated Apps folder. All other apps not in the list of apps go in the Separated Apps folder. Once separated, apps are not allowed to exist in both locations at one time, so an app must be either inside or outside the separated apps. The exception is third-party keyboards. Once the policy is set, it is pushed to end user devices. When the device user begins installing apps, the Knox framework separates the apps based on the configured policy. Already installed third-party apps in the Outside location are disabled in user0 and re-installed inside Separated Apps if they are not included in the app list. Third-party keyboards and UEM agents are not subject to this. The only way to change the location once the policy has been created is to disable and recreate the policy with a different setting. It cannot be changed once activated. For details about Separated Apps and other KSP policies, go to Configure advanced policies. Third-party keyboards Third-party keyboards are allowed to exist both outside and inside the Separated Apps folder, so the same keyboard can be used regardless of the location of the app being used. Any keyboard app that is installed is automatically installed in both locations. As such, keyboard apps will be ignored in the app list. Following is the default behavior for third party keyboards: After Separated Apps is created: All previously installed third-party keyboards are available in both locations. Newly installed third-party keyboards are available in both locations. If the device user uninstalls a third-party keyboard then it will be uninstalled from both locations. Upon disabling Separated Apps, all keyboards remain for the device owner (in user0). Access control policies The following access control policies are applied to the Separated Apps. These policies cannot be changed. By default, Managed Google Play is the only approved installer. External SD card access is not permitted for Separated Apps. Bluetooth sharing is not permitted for Separated Apps. Copy & Paste between apps inside and outside the Separated Apps is not permitted. USB file transfer is not permitted for Separated Apps. NFC is supported for Separated Apps except for payment-based NFC. Screen shots are permitted for Separate apps and saved in storage only accessible to the Separated Apps. Backup policy By default, backup is enabled for Separated Apps. If the device owner disables backup for entire device then backup for Separated Apps will also be disabled. If the device owner then enables backup again then backup for Separated Apps will also be enabled. VPN setup When using Separated Apps, you can set up the following types of VPN\"configurations through KSP: Full-device VPN: All apps on the device, both inside and outside the Separated Apps folder, use the same VPN tunnel. Per-app VPN: The IT admin can configure a VPN tunnel for select apps. Per-user VPN: The IT admin can configure a VPN tunnel for all apps inside or outside the Separated Apps folder. VPN chaining: IT admin can configure two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic. For help setting up these VPN\"configurations, browse the screens below, which show example settings. #Full-device VPN #Per-app VPN #Per-user VPN #VPN chaining #VPN profile",

            "content": "Work profile on company-owned devices. As described in Device management modes, Android 11 replaces the fully managed device with work profile with a new work profile on company-owned devices, to enhance the privacy of personal activities on company devices. The work profile on a company-owned device is: similar to that on a personally owned device, in that the enterprise uses a UEM\"app to serve as a profile owner, which fully manages work apps in a work profile , different from a personally owned device, in that if the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available to the device policy controller (DPC). If a work profile is added after the setup wizard using any other method, Android 11 recognizes the device as personally owned. The behavior and features available to work profiles on company-owned devices remains unchanged. If your enterprise needs to retain full control over devices, with a UEM\"app serving as Device Owner, consider using Separated Apps instead. Migrating to Android 11 #New enrollments With Android 11, you can no longer deploy a fully managed device with work profile. The DPC's request fails with no workaround. #Existing enrollments Upon upgrade to Android 11, any existing fully managed device with work profile deployments are auto-migrated to the new work profile on company-owned devices, as follows: A new device ownership flag will be set to company-owned, granting elevated privileges to the Profile Owner. Device-level and personal-use policies previously set by the Device Owner will be silently migrated to the Profile Owner or be unset. The Android policies that are migrated and policies that are unset can be found in Google's EMM migration guidelines. The now redundant Device Owner will be disabled, its privileges will be revoked, and any cross-profile communication with the Profile Owner will be severed. The complete list of Android Enterprise policies that will be: Migrated is found in Appendix A of Google's EMM migration guidelines.\"Policies will be migrated silently; DPCs will need to query policy state if they want to review the details.

For a full list of all Knox features across all versions, see our Knox on Android feature page. Samsung DeX management features Samsung DeX is a revolutionary new technology that allows users to transform their mobile devices into powerful enterprise desktops by simply connecting them into an external display (through DeX Station, DeX Pad, or HDMI adapter). This allows employees to work in desktop environment while operating under the same mobile policy management setup pushed by your MDM/MDM. For the 3.2 release, the Knox team is providing the following DeX-specific management features. Organize home screen apps - Align and organize apps in a preferred order. This is perfect for organizations that want to set up numerous identical workstations throughout their organization. Set custom web shortcuts - Add a custom icon on the DeX home screen to open a specific URL. This is useful for users that have to access a website frequently - for example, an internal Intranet network. Rich Communication Services (RCS) message capture Knox 3.2 allows IT Admins to capture RCS messages. For many industries, such as the financial services, the ability to audit sent and received messages is required by law. Improved Device Enrollment In Knox 3.2, device enrollment can be quickly done with a special gesture performed in the setup wizard. Knox Mobile Enrollment provides a streamlined IMEI bulk provisioning service for enterprise devices. While this is the ideal workflow, there are cases where IMEIs can't be registered in the system for various technical reasons. This additional feature allows you to enroll these devices easily. App permission monitor (APM) updates The following updates have been added to the App Permission Monitor service: Updated data collection - Collect location info, foreground + background app info and statistics on data that may have leaked via hidden background permissions. UX improvements - New button shortcut to turn off APM monitoring per app. More B2B policies - Force stop background apps. VPN updates , Device wide VPN support for DO and PO profiles - When targeting the new Knox Platform for Enterprise container, IT Admins can use a single VPN tunnel for traffic inside and outside of a container. Support VPN app blocklist - This feature allows IT Admins to blocklist specific VPN apps if needed. NPA updates NPA, long-lived flows, data collection, net flow , DNS requests are now attributed to the requesting app. New configuration options allow you to select when to sample data: beginning of flow, end of flow, or both. NPA now indicates if data is associated with the start or end of the flow. A new data point was added to identify the type of network, such as WiFi or VPN, over which a data flow occurs. Knox Workspace updates , Work profile icon name change - To avoid device user confusion, profiles created in Android have been renamed from \"Workspace\" to \"Work\". This is reflected in the icon name on the device. GDPR compliance - Knox Workspace is updated to meet the stringent requirements of GDPR. Back to release notes",

The Knox SDK 3.2.1 release removes the mini launcher functionality of previous Knox Workspace profiles. The Knox Workspace now uses a tabbed UI view to show personal and work apps. This enhancement benefits IT Administrator and end-user level users in the following ways: Reduces the number of IT support calls caused due to user confusion and other issues , Improves end-user experience and usability for users in these ways: Lets end-users seamlessly switch between personal and work apps without delay. Shows work apps in a separate tabbed view to provide a visual confirmation that the user is in the Knox Workspace. #Android P Knox Workspace Tabbed UI view To switch between personal and work apps, users tap the appropriate tab. When an unauthenticated user tries to launch any work app, they are prompted to enter their log-in credentials. Notice the name of the tab is Workspace, this indicates you are in the Knox Workspace instead of the personal side. #Settings Users of devices running the Knox 3.2.1 access Workspace settings directly from the device settings menu on the Personal side. There is no longer a separate \"Workspace settings\", as in previous versions of Knox. Certificate Provisioning IT Admins managing certificates and keystores no longer require the user to unlock the device before certificates can be installed. This allows admins to silently install a CA certificate into a given keystore. Keyboard Input Method (IME) The Keyboard security framework has received a major usability upgrade while maintaining security between the personal and work profiles. Unlike Android Enterprise, Knox Platform for Enterprise allows users to choose their own IME in the personal space without risking the integrity of Workspace data. For example: a device-user may accidentally download a keyboard containing malicious code and install it on the personal side. With Knox 3.2.1, this keyboard does not operate inside the Workspace. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Workspace IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit permission from IT admins. VPN Enhancements #Audit Log The Knox Generic VPN Framework enables common audit logs for VPN clients and helps non-native VPN clients meet NIAP security requirements. Performance Improvements IT Admins can now configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. This release adds a number of enhancements to VPN, including: Performance optimization to increase the speed of establishing VPN connections for a large number of apps. Synchronization of VPN connection and firewall configuration events. This ensures that VPN connection is established only after firewall has finished preparing for VPN mode.

This release provides the following. This feature is enabled by default on new devices released with Knox 3.3, but is not available to older devices with firmware updates to Knox 3.3. Dual DAR Dual DAR encryption allows enterprises to secure their work data with two layers of encryption, which provides protection to devices even while powered off or in an unauthenticated state. With single layer encryption, potential flaws in the implementation may result in a single point of failure. Contact Storage Restrictions IT Admins can restrict local contacts stored on enterprise devices to reduce the risk of losing contacts or becoming out of sync with contacts stored on an enterprise server. Knox on DeX Knox on DeX provides 4 new features to a Samsung DeX device: auto start, on-screen keyboard, open app on DeX display, and set custom wallpaper. Firewall Knox SDK 3.3 now supports the interaction between Domain Filter rules and Firewall policies. Without this feature enabled, Firewall policies can affect allowlist rules applied by Domain Filter. After enabling this, IT Admins can do the following use cases: Use Firewall Rules to block all IPs in a specified device. Use the Domain Filter Rules to allow specific domains to be allowed even if the IPs were blocked using Firewall policies. To learn more about this new feature, see Firewalls. VPN improvements This release includes several enhancements to improve user experience and VPN client performance on the Knox framework. The enhancements include: 1. Multi-app tunneling support - Enhances user experience when using VPN tunnels to allow users the ability to connect with and start using business apps immediately after establishing a VPN tunnel. 2. Knox event and Android networking event synchronization - Improves VPN client performance to allow the Knox container to recognize that the VPN client is connected without any delay. Network Platform Analytics This release includes ongoing network flow analytics for NPA purposes. This feature allows IT admins to configure EMM-based NPA tools to receive network statistics while the network connection is ongoing. Doing so efficiently gathers analytics for long lasting network sessions. Container Only Mode (COM) deprecation Container Only Mode is deprecated starting the release of Galaxy S10 running Knox 3.3 or any device launched after. If you're using COM/CL containers on a previous device, such as in the Galaxy S9 or S8, they will be supported until the end of life of the devices. See COM and CL Workspaces for more information.

Previously, the Android VPN Management for Knox app supported only Device Owner (DO) mode. Knox 3.6 now supports Profile Owner (PO) mode, enabling the same advanced Knox VPN capabilities from within a work profile. When installed inside a work profile, the new Knox app (v3.0.5) accesses an end-user/CA certificate inside the PO keystore to secure data transmission from within the work profile. The new Knox app is backwards compatible with devices running earlier, pre-3.6 versions of Knox. To deploy the new Android VPN Management for Knox Strongswan app in a work profile: 1. Log in to Knox Partner Portal > Dashboard > Download. 2. Download the new Android VPN Management for Knox Strongswan. 3. Configure a UEM profile to push and deploy the APK in a work profile. For more information about the advanced Knox VPN capabilities, see the Knox White Paper. Certificate authentication for USB-tethered laptops With Knox 3.5, Samsung Knox devices could extend a VPN tunnel to a laptop connected through USB. This provided laptop users with the ability to access internal enterprise resources using our defense-grade mobile VPN network. In addition to providing convenience when laptops do not have network connectivity, this offers company cost savings by removing the need to buy additional VPN licenses for laptops. Knox 3.6 enhances this feature with better security. There is a new app that enables Samsung Knox devices to verify that a laptop is owned by the device user. When the user connects a laptop to a Samsung Knox device via USB, the app validates the user certificate on the laptop with allowed certificates identified by the IT admin for the device. To deploy the new app to authenticate connected laptops: 1. Log in to Knox Partner Portal > Dashboard > Download. 2. Download the new USB Tethering Authentication for VPN. 3. Configure a UEM profile to push and deploy the APK to devices. 4. Identify the certificates of laptops allowed to connect via USB to each device for VPN access. The APK provided on the Knox Partner Portal supports only Samsung One UI flagship devices such as the Galaxy S/A/J and Tab S/A. We also have One UI Core devices such as the A21, Tab A7, M51, M31s, and A12. To deploy USB-tethered VPNs on a One UI Core device, please contact us to get another APK that uses a different Samsung platform signing key. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Platform for Enterprise 3.7 release notes. November 2020 The latest Samsung Knox 3.7 release features Android 11, which offers both: greater privacy to consumers using personal apps on company devices, sufficient controls to enterprise IT admins to protect corporate assets The Knox 3.7 platform is built into the firmware of new Samsung flagship devices, and will be installed on existing devices following the release schedule of mobile service providers. Work profile on company-owned devices As you may be aware, Android 10 introduced extensive changes to protect user privacy and give users more control over the personal data that apps could access. Android 11 further enhances privacy, on corporate devices that are enabled for personal use. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with work profile (also known as Corporate Owned Managed Profile or COMP) with work profile on company-owned device. The UEM apps used by enterprises to manage their devices no longer have device owner privileges over the personal profile, but instead have elevated profile owner privileges to protect corporate assets in the personal side. For more about these changes, see: Device management modes, Work profile on company-owned devices, Android policies in the personal profile, Knox policies in the personal profile Separated apps Some enterprises still need full (device owner) control over a device, while enabling users to install third-party business apps. For example, enterprises might need: password reset on the device, Mobile Threat Defense in user0, general visibility and control of DNS filtering, APN, and so on. In these scenarios, you can use Separated apps, which isolates third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. The third-party apps cannot intercommunicate with work apps or access confidential work data. See how to use the Knox Service Plugin to set up Separated apps. Deep Settings Customization This release expands the list of deep settings introduced with Knox 3.4, delivering options to configure the following Settings through the Knox Service Plugin. Setting , Description - , - Side key setting , The new Side key, which combines the Power and Bixby keys, can be configured for the events: double press and press-and-hold. The Side key can be also enabled or disabled. APN change disabling , The change of the Preferred APN can now be disabled after an IT admin sets the APN settings. Each KSP release introduces additional deep settings so you are encouraged to browse the KSP release notes for all the latest capabilities. Lock screen enhancements This release offers several customer-requested enhancements to the lock screen: Feature , Issue , Enhancement - , - , - Admin lock on Knox license expiry , When a license is expires, the device or the profile is immediately admin locked from a security and management point of view. The users can use the existing device or profile under the policies. Admin lock on maximum failed passwords , The device is admin locked when a user fails 5 times (assuming the maximum failed password count is 5). The profile (PO) will be admin locked or wiped instead of device locked when user fails 5 times. Face unlock for work profile , Lack of face unlock to open a work profile. Face authentication is allowed for the profile owner. To enable or disable this feature, use the API method setBiometricAuthenticationEnabled. Advanced access control for work profile , Once a device owner unlocks their work profile, unauthorized users can easily access the data inside the profile at any time. When a non-registered device user (who is not the owner) is detected, the profile is locked automatically base on face authentication. To enable or disable this feature, use the Knox Service Plugin. Bug fixes and feature enhancements The release fixes the following customer-reported bugs: Bug , Issue , Fix - , - , - Ownership transfer for DPM , In the case of a profile owner, a work profile is removed when an IT admin tries to transfer ownership using the API method DPM.transferOwnership. Ownership migration is now supported Filter data traffic for tethering using Firewall , Samsung devices provide an enhance Knox firewall, but the policy does not affect tethered devices such as laptops and tablets. The Knox firewall policy now includes tethered devices. Ultra-wideband control , UWB was introduced with the Galaxy Note20 but IT admins could not control it.

            "content": "Knox Platform for Enterprise 3.8 release notes. November 2021 Additional Advanced Access Control enhancements For device users who need security features over and above the standard features of Knox enterprise, this release provides additional Advanced Access Control (AAC) enhancements. These enhancements add additional KPE features and use Continuous Multi-Factor Authentication (CMFA) to automatically log users in to their phone and applications without needing their credentials at each log in. The framework uses the following factors to test the device's trust score: Face recognition factor that authenticates the user with facial recognition using the front facing camera. Device integrity factor that calls the keystore attestation API to obtain integrity information from ICCC TA. Touch Dynamics factor that uses commonly used keystroke pattern data to verify that the current user is authorized user of the device and the work profile. This release focuses on adding the previously mentioned touch dynamics factor. This factor analyzes the digital signatures generated when a human interacts with a device, commonly known as keystroke or typing patterns, to verify that the user typing on the device is the authorized primary user of the device. In cases where the user is determined not to be the primary, authorized user, the Work profile on the device is locked and access to sensitive data is immediately revoked. For more information on AAC, see Additional Advanced Access Control enhancements. Peripheral device management This release provides the partners a new SDK to develop applications for peripheral devices such as barcode scanners. Currently, the SDK supports KOAMTAK USB scanner and BT scanner. For details, see: Peripherals Overview , How it works , Tutorial Deep Settings Customization enhancements This feature is made available using Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Third-party apps cannot use Deep Settings Customization (DSC) directly. The Deep Settings Customization (DSC) enhancements made with this release close some UI vulnerabilities of device security controls as follows: Block gesture options in Kiosk mode - In some use cases, in spite of IT admins blocking the Home key in Kiosk mode, device users could use the Gesture event to exit the Kiosk mode and potentially access sensitive data. With this release, IT admins can enable Kiosk mode as well as disable the Gesture option in Advanced features. The IT admin can now restrict the device user from using the following gestures to exit the Kiosk mode: Short press the Home button. Swipe down from the center of the bottom edge of the screen. Support additional sound settings - IT admin can now use KSP to configure the sound options: Enable or disable system sound , Make system sounds silent , Hide settings menu using , Disable third-party content menu setting - The in-built Samsung keyboard allowed device users to select the Third-party content menu item on the Samsung keyboard to bypass restrictions on using the Internet on their devices. This release allows IT admins to disable the use of this menu from the Settings > Language and input > On-screen keyboard > Default keyboard > Samsung Keyboard settings > Third-party content. If the third-party app is already installed on the device, blocking this option does not disable the current keyboard deep settings. Users can still continue to access the Internet from this option. Disable Wi-Fi proxy settings menu - IT admins can now disable the use of the Wi-Fi proxy settings menu to ensure that a blacklisted domain is never accessible once the blacklisting policy is set. Restrict sharing of Wi-Fi profiles using QR codes - IT admins can now use KSP to restrict users from sharing Wi-Fi profiles, including login credentials and passwords, with other devices using QR codes. Change password settings - IT admins can now use KSP to hide or disable screen lock type menu item. IT admins can also set the screen lock type to None. Hide virtual keyboard when an external keyboard is connected - With this release, IT admins can now hide the virtual keyboard that shows up on the device's screen even when an external keyboard or input device (such as a scanner) is connected to the device. Each KSP release introduces additional deep settings so you are encouraged to browse the KSP release notes or KSP policy schema for all the latest capabilities. Optimize SUW for AER for managed devices Currently, the setup wizard (SUW) for Android Enterprise Recommended (AER) devices includes options that allow device users to consent to collection of marketing and other data. The collection of these items is not recommended or appropriate for managed devices. To close this gap, the SUW should be changed to disallow data collection. To implement this change, the SUW now includes options that allow the user to consent to data collection, but in case of managed devices, data collection is automatically disabled for the device. Device users can further modify these options from the Device Settings > Privacy menu. For more information on this feature, see Optimized Setup Wizard for AER (Android Enterprise Recommended). Separated Apps v2 This release adds additional functionality to the features available with Separated Apps V1. Separated Apps V2 features include items that were either not released with V1 or identified as needing enhancements after V1 was released. V2 includes the following features: Improve the Separated Apps user experience - The Separated Apps user experience sees the improvements allowing device users to: Change folder names and color for Separated Apps , Select multiple Separated Apps for uninstallation , Long-press the Separated Apps app icon to bring up a quick option menu, similar to other apps , Allow use of biometric methods for Separated Apps - For devices where biometric authentication methods are set up in User0 or for other apps, Separated Apps can now use these registered biometric methods as well. Currently, biometric settings for Separated Apps are also controlled by the common Device Settings menu. Set remote control and screen capture behavior - IT admins can now control the remote control and screen capture features not only for User0 but also for Separated Apps. Depending upon whether the screen capture and remote control features are activated from within User0 or Separated Apps, the resulting image or media is stored in User0 or Separated Apps storage space. VPN platform enhancements, Auto Recreation of profile This release includes VPN enhancements to improve the security of managed devices. For managed devices, the VPN framework tries to recreate the VPN profile configuration and reconnect the VPN connection automatically for any VPN clients installed on managed devices. This automatic reconnection happens in the following two cases: A device user clears data intentionally or accidentally , There is an issue with the VPN client during the create connection process, and the database saving process is not complete, such as during device reboot or VPN client restart This automatic reconnection feature ensures there is no data leakage for apps that are configured to connect using the VPN profile. In cases where the reconnection effort fails, the VPN framework notifies the EMM client, allowing it to apply security policies such as locking the Work container or the entire device, as well as apply firewall rules and recreate VPN policies. To read more about this feature, see VPN Platform Enhancement. Android 12 OS changes , Password policy modifications - This release improves the password complexity feature to reduce the risk of users forgetting their passwords and needing to factory reset their devices to reset the password. This feature sets device-wide password requirements in the form of predefined complexity buckets, such as High, Medium, Low, and None. If necessary, IT admins can then set stricter password requirements on the work profile's security challenge. Sensor permission restrictions - IT admins can no longer silently grant the permissions to use the location, camera, microphone, body, or physical activity sensor. Managed device control enhancements - The following new features are available for company-owned devices: An IT administrator can disable USB, except for charging functions, on company-owned devices. This feature includes the capability to check if this feature is supported on the device and if it is currently enabled. Company-owned devices with a work profile can limit the input methods used in the personal profile to allow only system input methods. Back to release notes",

October 2022 Introducing unified work profiles Previously, there were two types of work profiles supported on Samsung devices - work profile, and work profile (Premium). Available features in these 2 types of work profiles depended on whether a Knox Platform for Enterprise premium license was activated. However, Knox Platform for Enterprise is now a free product as of July 2021, and all the premium features of Knox Platform for Enterprise and work profile (Premium) are supported free of charge. On devices running Android 13 and higher, work profile and work profile (Premium) are combined to have a unified work profile, which offers all the premium and basic features in one place. A KPE premium license activation is still required in order to use the KPE premium features or the APIs in the unified work profile. To learn about these new changes, see Work profile unification. DSC enhancement - Change device name remotely With the Deep Settings Customization (DSC) of the Knox Service Plugin, you can change the name of a device remotely using your MDM console. This might come in handy when, for example, you want the device name to be the same as its Bluetooth connection name. This feature is only available using the Knox Service Plugin in a future release. Third-party apps cannot use DSC directly. API deprecation As part of Samsung's ongoing efforts to streamline our services with the market, we deprecate certain APIs from time to time. Deprecated APIs in Knox 3.9 will work normally for Android 13. Additionally, we continue to provide technical support for deprecated APIs up to one year after the deprecation. The APIs continue to be available in the second year after deprecation but satisfactory operation can't be guaranteed. We recommend replacing newly deprecated APIs before they are removed permanently. Please see API deprecation journey for details. See the list of deprecated APIs for a list of APIs sunsetted in this and past releases. KPE Premium licenses generation on Knox Developer Portal Previously, the Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license was generated from the Knox Portal (samsungknox.com), and the Knox Platform for Enterprise Standard license was generated from the Knox Developer Portal (developer.samsungknox.com). Both licenses can now be generated from the Knox Developer Portal. For details, see Knox licenses in the Knox developer documentation. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Platform for Enterprise 3.10 release notes. Explore the new features, improvements, and fixes that were delivered with Knox Platform for Enterprise 3.10. Certificate distribution through ACME protocol Knox 3.10 adds support for Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) as a certificate management protocol. Using ACME with Knox offers some major benefits compared to other certificate protocol and platform solutions: The client's identity - in this case, a Samsung device - is attested through a hardware-backed asymmetric key pair instead of a shared secret. The private key on the device is never exposed, so if an attacker intercepts the public key during a transaction, they won't be able to use that information to impersonate the device. It eases the deployment of new certificates to a large number of devices by installing them automatically and silently. The device user doesn't need to take any action when a new certificate becomes available, reducing IT overhead and certificate coverage when users are neglectful or uncertain. Within the Knox implementation of this protocol, Knox acts as the agent between the EMM and the ACME server that acts as a certificate authority (CA) by coordinating the certificate transaction. When a new certificate is published, an IT admin in your enterprise can send a command to your device fleet through your EMM. When a device receives this signal, the built-in Knox framework queries the CA, and correctly identifies and authenticates itself during the initial challenge-response. When the CA is certain that the request and the device are genuine, it sends the certificate to the device, which in turn seamlessly places said certificate into its Android keystore. For a more technical look at how ACME works within the Knox platform, see the release material for Knox SDK 3.10. Granular SIM restrictions With Knox 3.9, the platform could disable the secondary physical SIM slot on devices. While handy for enterprises that needed to enforce a particular cell service, this feature didn't account for more complex hardware setups, such as devices that have the SIM slot numbers reversed, or that have eSIMs. Devices carrying a combination of physical SIMs and eSIMs have become increasingly common in many regions of the world, and are likely to continue growing in popularity. To account for more complex cellular service plans, Knox 3.10 now offers additional capabilities for controlling Samsung devices. Enterprises can now: Disable either SIM slot on dual-SIM devices, Prevent device users from disabling SIM slots, Block new eSIMs, Disable existing eSIMs, Disable all eSIMs except eSIM 1 Force single-window view on Settings app The Galaxy S23, Flip5, and Fold5 support Multi window, a feature that allows users to multitask with two apps at the same time. By default, the Settings app on these devices opens in this split screen view. The Knox team was made aware by its partners of a potential security vulnerability - some EMM agents can't monitor and restrict the device user's actions in the Settings app while it's in Multi window view. To cover this security gap, Knox 3.10 now has the capability to force the Settings app into the standard single-screen view. Audit log enhancements Knox 3.10 makes the audit log more convenient for developers by consolidating all entries into a single file on the device. Enhancements to UCM keystore and keyguard The Knox platform's Universal Credential Management (UCM) provides a plug-and-play framework to ease the management of credentials across a variety of different storage media. In particular, it provides higher mobile security by supporting the storage and management of major certificates and credentials for embedded devices. The UCM keystore now supports AES, ECDSA (with NIST and Brainpool curves), and HMAC cipher and signature algorithms. Back to release notes",

There is one type of Knox Workspace license: two-yearly, based on its billing period type. This license expires two years after its activation date. If the license is not extended with an extension order and expires, depending upon the device's OS, two kinds of user behaviors can happen: Android R OS and higher - For devices running Android R OS and higher, the Work container can be used, but KPE APIs can no longer be called, causing IT admins' inability to apply KPE policies until the license is activated again. OS lower than Android R - For devices running an OS lower than Android R, the Work container gets locked and KPE APIs can no longer be called. But the data inside the container are not removed, and the user re-gains access to the container and data after license is extended or reactivated. Some Q OS devices may exhibit user behavior similar to R OS devices. Below are the limitations to the container when the license expires: If a container exists, the container will be locked and inaccessible until the license is extended or reactivated in some Q OS devices and devices with an OS lower than Q OS. You cannot push any Knox Workspace policies to devices. All Knox Workspace policies set in the EMM admin console are maintained and can't be updated.",

In Samsung Knox-enabled devices, there is a security mechanism that monitors during the device boot and in runtime if the device is ever rooted, and leaves an undeletable mark on a rooted device. Using this information, Knox Workspace determines if it's safe to install or maintain the container on the device. If an IT admin tries to create Knox Workspace on a rooted device, installation is denied. Unauthorized firmware on the device implies that there can be an unknown security hole, putting corporate data in the container at risk. Therefore, Knox Workspace is not installed unless integrity of the device is proven. Likewise, even if Knox Workspace is already installed and activated, if the device finds out it's rooted, it permanently locks the container as a possible security threat.",

For example, if you recently upgraded your device to Android P, your Knox version is also automatically upgraded to Knox 3.2.1. To check if your device is capable of a Knox upgrade. 1. Check the Android version that you need for your device to run Knox. Before installing this Android version, do some research on the changes that come with the new version. 2. Check the Android version currently on your device: Settings > General > About device > Android version. 3. Check the software updates that are currently available: Settings > General > About device > Software update > Update. 4. Install the Android update.

The Samsung Knox warranty bit is a security feature that detects if unofficial software has been installed on your phone. This helps prevent malicious attempts from accessing your data. The Knox Warranty Bit detects if a non-Knox kernel has been loaded on the device. It is a one-time programmable bit e-fuse, which can only be turned from 0X0 to 0X1 (i.e. tripped). If a non-Knox boot loader or kernel has been installed on the device, Knox can no longer guarantee the security of the Knox container. As a result, the Warranty Bit is tripped to 0X1, indicating that this device can no longer use the Knox Workspace (container). If the Knox bit has tripped: A new Workspace can no longer be created on such a device. The data encrypted and stored in an existing Workspace can no longer be retrieved. Other Samsung services that utilize Knox security stop working (Samsung Pay, Secure Folder.) Everything else outside the Workspace should be the same as before. To check whether the Warranty Bit has tripped for new Samsung models: 1. Connect a compatible USB cable to a powered-on PC. 2. Power off the device. 3. Once off, simultaneously press and hold the volume up and volume down buttons. 4. While holding the buttons, connect the USB cable to the device. 5. When a warning screen shows, release the buttons and press the volume up button. 6. The Warranty Bit status (warranty void) is displayed on a screen among other parameters. 7. Disconnect the USB cable, then simultaneously press and hold the volume up and power buttons for more than 7 seconds to exit and reboot the device. Method for older devices with a home button To check whether the Warranty Bit has tripped for older devices: 1. Power off the device. 2. Once off, simultaneously press the volume down, home, and power button. 3. When warning screen is displayed, press the volume up button. 4. The Warranty Bit status is displayed in upper-left corner. If the Warranty Bit is tripped, the device displays Knox WARRANTY VOID: 0x01. If that is the case, there is no way to revert the Warranty Bit and Knox won't work on this device. The only way to get the device back to its original settings is to replace the PBA (Printed Board Assembly) on the device; hardware replacement will be required.

Security Enhancements for Android (SE for Android) prevents apps or processes from accessing data and resources that they are not allowed to. For example, apps outside the Knox container are not allowed to access app data inside the container. SE for Android provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) over traditional Discretionary Access Control (DAC) environments. SE for Android can grant special privileges based specific EMM policies. In DAC environments, since SE for Android controls access of kernel resources, certain apps may not run as intended. Samsung's MAC feature allows your apps to run properly alongside SE for Android. SE for Android secures the operating system as follows: Partitions the operating system into security domains. Within each domain, apps are given the minimal permissions they need to function. This contains the damage that might be caused by malicious or flawed apps, as problems in one domain do not spread to another. Uses a policy file to define which users and apps can access which files and resources. You cannot override this policy file and, for example, grant yourself access to files or resources that would otherwise be restricted. To ensure that your device uses the latest policies defined for the latest apps, enable the policy file to be updated automatically. When SE for Android detects an unauthorized access, it displays a notification message. For instructions on how to access SE for Android settings, see the Knox Workspace Admin guide.",

The most frequently asked questions about Knox Service Plugin New Knox policies are released to customers as a Knox Service Plugin app update in the Google Play Store. IT Admins can easily use the updated app to push new polices to managed devices. UEMs do not need to perform any additional development for each Knox release. Each Knox policy that Knox Service Plugin supports is published as a Managed Configuration. A Managed Configuration file is an XML file within that particular app. Whenever a new version of Knox Service Plugin including new Knox policies is released to the Google Play Store, IT Admins use the same UEM console to immediately import the new version and see the new policies.",

The most frequently asked questions about Knox Service Plugin As a general guideline, we recommend that you use the built-in features that your UEM console provides, and use Knox Service Plugin only for applying additional policies that are available only through Knox Service Plugin and KPE. For example, lets say you want to disable Bluetooth on a device. If your UEM console already supports disabling Bluetooth, then don't use Knox Service Plugin to disable Bluetooth. If the UEM Console supports all the Knox device restrictions you want to apply on the device, then set up the policy with the UEM console and don't use the \"device restrictions\" section of the Knox Service Plugin managed configuration. That is, keep \"Enable device restriction controls\" disabled. However, if you need to use even a single device restriction in Knox Service Plugin, then you should turn on \"Enable device restriction controls\" and then set up all the device restriction controls within that structure.",

A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) provided by Client Certificate Manager (CCM) can be used to generate a RSA Key Pair of size 1024 or 2048 bits. Key Pairs generated by CCM are secured in TrustZone. The Private Key is never revealed and only handled while performing crypto operations. When CCM detects that device is compromised, it is locked and none of the keys can be used on a compromised device. PKCS10 format CSRs generated in CCM can be used with Microsoft CA to issue certificate which can be installed in CCM. Certificates installed in CCM can be used by Email, Browser, VPN, WiFi, or any other 3rd party app. Samsung has certificate enrollment protocols, SCEP, EST, CMP clients which can be used for certificate enrollment. These clients are integrated with CCM and can be used to enroll certificates either in CCM (TrustZone solution) or the default Android credential store.",

Cause The CCM, Client Certificate Manager keystore is divided into two separate parts: TLC, Trustlet Communicator, TZ, Trust Zone Although we can store certificates larger than 8192 bytes in size, there is limitation while reading the certificates from CCM Keystore. TLC and TZ is expecting the certificates that do not exceed 8192 Bytes and truncate certificates read from CCM to this size. Please note that certificates are encrypted prior to storing them in the CCM Keystore. This causes the certificate size to grow after encryption. Resolution As a workaround, we recommend using certificates with key size smaller than 8192 bytes.",

Summary Samsung SSO Authenticator for Kerberos is returning error code: -1765328230, KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) not found. Cause Using Kerberos SSO requires the mobile device to be connected to the same network as your Active Directory (AD) server. Usually to meet this requirement, a VPN has to be used. If there is no direct connection to the AD server, the SSO service will not work. This is because Kerberos is using port 88, which is blocked in some public networks, to perform authentication. Resolution Use a VPN, or set Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) proxy to use port 443 instead of 88. The port 443 is opened on public networks, so VPN is not needed. Windows Server 2012 is needed for the KDC proxy. There are two possible configurations: 1. Both AD and KDC proxy are running on one machine with Windows Server 2012. 2. AD is running on one machine (Windows Server may be older than 2012) and the KDC proxy is running on the second machine with Windows Server 2012. Once the KDC Proxy is set, the Authenticator on the device has to be configured. There are two ways to configure Authenticator: 1. Provide config file via EMM application. 2. Side load from internal storage on device. When the AD IT admin sets the KDC proxy, he should have a URL such as: `https://KDCproxy.mycompany.com` The krb5.conf file should have the following line defined: `KDC_PROXY=https://KDCproxy.mycompany.com` This config file should be distributed to devices. When the SSO app will try to obtain a Token, the Authenticator application will be opened. There is a 'View more' button at the bottom which allows viewing additional settings. You should use 'Location of krb5.conf' field to put the path to the file manually or push small directory icon on the right of the screen and pick config file from the file explorer.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Enhanced roaming algorithm. Basic roaming algorithm Roaming is a term used to describe when a device goes out of range of one Access Point (AP) and shifts Wi-Fi network association to the next available AP within the same Extended Service Set (ESS) without losing connection. There are 3 factors that trigger roaming on a Samsung mobile device: 1. Weak signal - Mobile devices trigger a roaming scan to avoid frequent retransmissions from lost packets. When the current AP's Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value is weak (below -75dBm), the device searches for an AP with a stronger signal. 2. Beacon loss - When beacon packets from a connected AP isn't received after 2 seconds (6 second if the display is OFF), the mobile device considers it a lost beacon and triggers a roaming scan. 3. Channel Utilization (CU) - When multiple clients are connected to the same AP, connectivity may be hindered despite having a strong radio signal due to limited resources. In which case, the AP will notify the clients of its current traffic through the CU factor in its beacon. The mobile device will then trigger a roaming scan if the received CU value is greater than 70 percent and the current RSSI value is between -65dBM and -75dBm. Currently, CU roaming is supported on Galaxy S and Note series devices released since the Galaxy S8. The mobile devices will choose to connect to a new AP with 10dBm higher RSSI value than the current AP from the result of its roaming scan triggered by the aforementioned cases. Save roaming channels The purpose of roaming is to provide a seamless data experience. However, data may be muted while performing roaming scans. To remedy this, Samsung mobile devices support partial scanning for a more efficient roaming performance. For a partial scan, a mobile device maintains a list of channels containing the same SSID at every scan. During roaming, the device will only scan for the channels in this list instead of a full-channel scan. This helps the device to update the scan list at a much faster rate. For example, on Galaxy S series, an active scan takes 40ms and a passive scan (on DFS channels) takes 130ms. With this, a legacy full-scan takes about 2800ms to complete while a partial scan with 7 saved channels will only take about 280ms - a 90% improvement. Opportunistic key caching During roaming, data is muted until the mobile device completes connecting to a new AP. To avoid user-level interference, Samsung mobile devices use Opportunistic Key Caching (OKC) to speed up roaming connection. OKC allows the wireless client and the WLAN infrastructure to cache only one PMK for the lifetime of the client association with this WLAN (derived from the MSK after the initial 802.1X/EAP authentication with the Authentication Server). This holds even when roaming between multiple APs where they all share the original PMK that is used as the seed on all WPA2 4-way handshakes. Note that this is not an 802.11-standardized method for roaming. Advantage of 802.11r 802.11r or Fast BSS Transition (FT) seeks to reduce the length of time of lost connectivity between the STA and the DS during a BSS transition. The FT protocols are part of the Re-Association service, and they only apply to STA transitions between APs within the same mobility domain of the same ESS. IEEE 802.11r specifies FT between access points by redefining the security key negotiation protocol, allowing both the negotiation and requests for wireless resources (similar to RSVP but defined in 802.11e) to occur in parallel. The key negotiation protocol in 802.11i requires the client to renegotiate its key with a RADIUS or other authentication server supporting Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) on every handoff for a 802.1X-based authentication, which is a time-consuming process. To save time, part of the key derived from server is cached in the wireless network, which allows a reasonable number of future connections to be based on the cached key instead of re-running 802.11X process every time. The non-802.11r BSS transition takes the following steps. 1. Run a roaming scan and find an AP for roaming. 2. Exchange 802.11 Authentication messages with the target access point, first from the client, then from the AP. 3. Exchange Re-Association messages to establish connection at the target AP. 4. Start 802.1X/EAP authentication and derive a Master Session Key (MSK). 5. Derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) by using the 802.11i 4-Way Handshake of session keys to create a unique encryption key for the association base on the Master Session Key. FT follows the same procedure except for the 802.1X negotiation where it piggybacks the PTK exchanges with the 802.11 Authentication and Re-Association messages instead. 802.11r supported devices All Samsung Android devices from Android P and onwards support 802.11r. Advantage of 802.11k (neighbor report, beacon report) The 802.11k standard allows STAs or APs to get WLAN information from each other. There are many features regarding this, but mobile devices currently only support neighbor report and beacon report features. Both STAs and APs are able to get information about nearby APs through neighbor and beacon reports respectively. 1. Neighbor Report As explained in partial scanning section, the mobile device maintains a roaming channel list to reduce scan time. But, there are cases where the device may trigger a full-scan in order to find a roaming AP. In the following diagram, the mobile device initially finds AP1 and AP2 and saves CH 1 and CH 35 in the roaming channel list after connecting to AP2. When the mobile device moves from Location1 to Location2, roaming will be triggered at point, Trigger1 due to a weak RSSI value. While the mobile device tries to find a roaming candidate in CH 1 and CH 36 via a partial scan, it is not able to find any other AP from the list other than AP2. Only after a full-scan will the mobile device discover AP3 and AP4 where it will add CH 11 and CH 46 to its roaming channel list after it connects to AP4. Having neighbor reports avoids full-scans from such instance from happening. Initially, mobile device will save CH 1 and CH 36 in the channel list as it connects to AP2, which is equal to previous case. Then, in addition, it will also send a neighbor report request to AP2. AP2 will return a list of nearby AP's, which is AP1, AP2 and AP4. From this response, mobile devices will add CH 11 in its roaming channel list. As the mobile device moves away from Location 1 to Location2, the device will run a partial roaming scan at Trigger1 for CH 1, CH 11 and CH 36. This time, the device finds AP4 from its partial scan and successfully connects to AP4. After roaming success, mobile device will repeat the steps by sending a neighbor request to AP4. 2. Beacon Report APs may support roaming by sharing its neighbor list or BTM request. These requests serve as a list of recommended roaming candidates for the client devices. However, if this information is incorrect, it may disorient mobile devices' roaming decisions. To suggest the best roaming candidate to a client, AP may receive other APs' distances from its device client through a beacon report. When mobile device receives a beacon report request, it will run a scan to collect beacon frames with their respective signal strengths and return it to the AP. The AP then, can choose the best roaming AP by combining internal information with the received beacon report. 802.11k supported devices (Updated March 2023) , Galaxy S23 Ultra (SM-S918), Galaxy S23+ (SM-S916), Galaxy S23 (SM-S911), Galaxy S22 Ultra (SM-S908), Galaxy S22+ (SM-S906), Galaxy S22 (SM-S901), Galaxy S21 FE 5G (SM-G990), Galaxy Z Fold4 5G (SM-F936), Galaxy Z Flip4 5G (SM-F721), Galaxy Z Fold3 5G (SM-F926), Galaxy Z Flip3 5G (SM-F711), Galaxy XCover6 Pro (SM-G736), Galaxy XCover Pro (SM-G715), Galaxy XCover5 (SM-G525), Galaxy M54 5G (SM-M546), Galaxy A54 5G (SM-A546), Galaxy A34 5G (SM-A346), Galaxy M34 5G (SM-M346), Galaxy M14 5G (SM-M146), Galaxy A14 5G (SM-A146), Galaxy A73 5G (SM-A736), Galaxy M53 5G (SM-M536), Galaxy A53 5G (SM-A536), Galaxy A33 5G (SM-A336), Galaxy A23 5G (SM-A236), Galaxy A13 5G (SM-A136), Galaxy A13 (SM-A135), Galaxy A03s (SM-A037), Galaxy M33 5G (SM-M336), Galaxy M23 5G (SM-M236), Galaxy A52s 5G (SM-A528), Galaxy A22 5G (SM-A226), Galaxy A22 (SM-A225), Galaxy M32 (SM-M325), Galaxy S20 (SM-G980), Galaxy S20 5G (SM-G981), Galaxy S20+ (SM-G985), Galaxy S20+ 5G (SM-G986), Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G (SM-G988), Galaxy Fold (SM-F900), Galaxy Fold 5G (SM-F907), Galaxy Note 10+ (SM-N975), Galaxy Note 10 (SM-N970), Galaxy Note 10 5G (SM-N971), Galaxy Note 10+ 5G (SM-N976), Galaxy S10e (SM-G970), Galaxy S10 (SM-G973), Galaxy S10+ (SM-G975), Galaxy Note 9 (SM-N960), Galaxy S9+ (SM-G965), Galaxy S9 (SM-G960), Galaxy Note 8 (SM-N950), Galaxy S8+ (SM-G955), Galaxy S8 (SM-G950) Advantage of 802.11v (BSS Transition Management) 802.11v standard (Wireless Network Management) allows STAs to exchange information for the purpose of improving overall performance of the wireless network. This standard also has many services but mobile devices currently only supports BTM (BSS Transition Management). Typically, a mobile device monitors its Wi-Fi link condition for roaming. However, it is unaware of what goes on inside the connected AP such as load balance, reboot schedule and number of clients, etc. With the support of BTM, an AP can request its device client to roam to another AP with a better network condition. When Samsung mobile device receives a BTM request, it will trigger a partial roaming scan. If mobile device is able to find an AP with better connection (currently 5%), it will roam to that AP. Otherwise, it will maintain its current Wi-Fi connection. AP's may indicate its severity of roaming recommendation to its client with elements in BTM request. if an AP strongly recommends a mobile device to roam to another AP, it can set the \"Abridged Bit\" in the BTM request to 1, where mobile device may consider and regard it as a higher priority. When \"Disassociation Imminent Bit\" is set to 1 in the BTM request, it indicates that the connected client has 10 seconds before receiving a dis-association packets from its host AP. The AP may use this to force its client to roam to a different AP in necessary cases such as when AP is resetting or when its resources are maxed out. The picture below shows a case where number of clients connected to an AP increases as people walk in to a restaurant. Assuming that the connected band is 2.4GHz with RSSI higher than -60dBm and CU at -60%. At the moment, mobile device will not trigger roaming, but with increasing number of clients from people entering, AP1 may decide to move some of the clients to AP2's 5GHz band. Consequently, AP1 sends BTM requests recommending AP2's 5GHz network to its clients. Upon receiving BTM requests from AP, device clients will calculate their own roaming score internally make roaming decisions. 802.11v supported devices (Updated March 2023) , Galaxy S23 Ultra (SM-S918), Galaxy S23+ (SM-S916), Galaxy S23 (SM-S911), Galaxy S22 Ultra (SM-S908), Galaxy S22+ (SM-S906), Galaxy S22 (SM-S901), Galaxy S21 FE 5G (SM-G990), Galaxy Z Fold4 5G (SM-F936), Galaxy Z Flip4 5G (SM-F721), Galaxy Z Fold3 5G (SM-F926), Galaxy Z Flip3 5G (SM-F711), Galaxy XCover6 Pro (SM-G736), Galaxy XCover Pro (SM-G715), Galaxy XCover5 (SM-G525), Galaxy M54 5G (SM-M546), Galaxy A54 5G (SM-A546), Galaxy A34 5G (SM-A346), Galaxy M34 5G (SM-M346), Galaxy M14 5G (SM-M146), Galaxy A14 5G (SM-A146), Galaxy A73 5G (SM-A736), Galaxy M53 5G (SM-M536), Galaxy A53 5G (SM-A536), Galaxy A33 5G (SM-A336), Galaxy A23 5G (SM-A236), Galaxy A13 5G (SM-A136), Galaxy A13 (SM-A135), Galaxy A03s (SM-A037), Galaxy M33 5G (SM-M336), Galaxy M23 5G (SM-M236), Galaxy A52s 5G (SM-A528), Galaxy A22 5G (SM-A226), Galaxy A22 (SM-A225), Galaxy M32 (SM-M325), Galaxy S20 (SM-G980), Galaxy S20 5G (SM-G981), Galaxy S20+ (SM-G985), Galaxy S20+ 5G (SM-G986), Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G (SM-G988), Galaxy Fold (SM-F900), Galaxy Fold 5G (SM-F907), Galaxy Note 10+ (SM-N975), Galaxy Note 10 (SM-N970), Galaxy Note 10 5G (SM-N971), Galaxy Note 10+ 5G (SM-N976), Galaxy S10e (SM-G970), Galaxy S10 (SM-G973), Galaxy S10+ (SM-G975), Galaxy Note 9 (SM-N960), Galaxy S9+ (SM-G965), Galaxy S9 (SM-G960), Galaxy Note 8 (SM-N950), Galaxy S8+ (SM-G955), Galaxy S8 (SM-G950)",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Knox PAC Support (Proxy Auto Config). What is PAC? PAC (Proxy Auto Config) is a text file that instructs a browser or an app to forward traffic to a certain proxy server, instead of directly to the destination website. It contains JavaScript that specifies the proxy server, and optionally, additional parameters that specify when and under what circumstances a browser forwards traffic to the proxy server. For example: In a corporate network, an IT manager may enforce employees to type in the URL of the PAC file in the settings menu of their browsers. The browser would then connect to a proxy server first based on the routing logic stated in the PAC file. In Internet Explorer, this option can be found under Internet Options > Connection > LAN Settings > Auto Configuration Script. Why are proxies needed? Forwarding traffic to a proxy server instead of directly connecting to the destination server protects end devices from potential security threats by hiding their IP address, location, and other personal information. The destination server sees the traffic coming from the proxy server, instead of from the end devices. Additionally, if an IT department mandates employees to connect to the Internet through proxy servers only, corporate-level and employee-level traffic history can be monitored and tracked from the proxy server. This can reduce network costs by reducing the amount of Internet traffic going in and out of the company. Frequently visited websites and content are stored in the proxy server for immediate delivery to the end devices. What's the benefit of PAC? Large companies, especially in security sensitive industries (i.e. government, financial services, etc.) usually operate multiple proxy servers to balance and categorize traffic load. PAC can enable these large organizations to easily configure the forwarding rules on a single text file for all proxy servers. The IT department can enforce the same Internet traffic rules for both mobile devices and PC's to better manage their security by white-listing which firewall ports are open or closed. How does Knox support Proxy and PAC? There are two options to enable proxy or PAC function on Samsung devices: 1. Option 1: A user can type the proxy server address or the PAC URL on the settings menu of the device itself. 2. Option 2: An IT manager can seamlessly push the proxy or PAC profile to the device remotely. To remotely push PAC profiles (Option 2), Knox provides a set of APIs for EMMs to configure proxy and PAC settings remotely through Knox SDK. Each EMM provider needs to develop the feature on their EMM server and client. Support for proxy and PAC Support for PAC varies by connection type and Knox version: #Global Type , Configuring proxy/PAC to all HTTP traffic from device (3G/4G, WiFi, VPN) , Not able to configure proxy/PAC to traffic from the container or from individual apps #WiFi Type , Configuring proxy/PAC to all traffic via WiFi , Not able to configure from the container or app-level #VPN Type , Configuring proxy/PAC to all traffic via VPN , VPN tunneling from the device and VPN gateway right before reaching the proxy serve , Capable of configuring proxy/PAC to traffic from the container only or from particular apps only Knox also supports basic and advanced authentication methods for access to proxy servers: 1.

            "content": "Intelligent Wi-Fi. Intelligent Wi-Fi provides four features that aim to improve consumers' Wi-Fi experience: 1. Network Bearer Switching 2. Auto Wi-Fi 3. Suspicious Hotspot Detection 4. Enhanced Power Saving Intelligent Wi-Fi is the new brand name of the existing \"Adaptive Wi-Fi\" which had been applied to models older than Galaxy S10 (e.g. Galaxy S9 or older models). It has been improved by adding a new feature such as Suspicious Network Detection and also enhancing existing features such as Network Bearer Switching. We care about speed, and we also care about your spending. With more than ten years of experience in Wi-Fi technology on mobile devices, Samsung has been conducting extensive research on features that actually improve the Wi-Fi experience for consumers. As a result, we have identified four main consumer concerns, and developed solutions with artificial intelligence and a mix of other existing technologies: 1. Network Bearer Switching #1-1. Enhanced Gray Area Detection Consumers are often frustrated when they lose Internet connection or experience very low quality of service (QoS), even when the Wi-Fi signal seems to be strong. This is one of the most commonly reported consumer concerns over using Wi-Fi, the so-called \"\u02dcgray areas'. In 2015, Samsung introduced an industry first - a technology that enables gray area detection and automatic network switching: Switch to Mobile Data (formerly referred to as \"\u02dcSmart Network Switch'). Gray areas can occur in a wide range of environments and in multiple forms, and Switch to Mobile Data is the solution for quickly switching from Wi-Fi to a mobile data network when a gray area is encountered. This new technology, which has been applied to the Galaxy S10 and later models such as the Galaxy Note 10, detects gray areas based on a wider range of technologies available to us, including sensors and artificial intelligence. Sensors collect context information, and artificial intelligence engines then analyze this data to determine the presence of a gray area. Our upgraded version switches networks faster, particularly in the following circumstances: Areas with a sudden loss of connection, i.e. in elevators, Unstable Wi-Fi on moving vehicles, including buses, trains, and subways Our new software contributes to a significant reduction in Internet disconnections, as shown in the following figure. #1-2. Preference Tracking Switch to Mobile Data is a technology that automatically switches from a mobile data network to Wi-Fi and vice versa. When we first launched this feature in 2015, it became popular among carriers and users, although some consumers were left unsatisfied. Since the switching criteria was previously based on network performance, it would switch to a mobile data network even when the consumer would have preferred to stay on Wi-Fi. We have been experimenting with various ways of improving network switching to better fit user preference and network usage patterns. As a result, we have created a new switching technology based on reinforcement learning, which automatically switches networks based on both network quality and user preference. Our new connection manager will not activate until it has accumulated enough data on user preference. On average, it will track your network usage preferences for approximately 10 days. *As a result of Galaxy S9 Internal User Trial (2018), it took an average of 9.9 days to determine user preferences. When it has gathered enough data to determine which of the above types you fall into, it will then initiate the automatic network switching scheme. For instance, if you prefer to conserve your data, the connection manager will remain on Wi-Fi as long as possible. On the contrary, if it detects that you prefer speed above all, it will attempt to switch to a mobile data network as soon as the Wi-Fi coverage begins to drop. If your preferences change over time, our new connection manager will continue to track your actions in order to accommodate your needs. 2. Auto Wi-Fi People use Wi-Fi differently based on their location. In places where Wi-Fi is available, we turn on Wi-Fi to avoid being charged for mobile data. On the other hand, if Wi-Fi is always on, we are subjected to frequent, unwanted connections and higher power consumption. To solve this problem, we have introduced Auto Wi-Fi, which turns Wi-Fi on and off depending on your location. Auto Wi-Fi addresses these connectivity-related pain points. Auto Wi-Fi pays close attention to your connection patterns and remembers your favorite networks. It turns your Wi-Fi on when a favorite network is available. When you leave the area and the network becomes unavailable, Auto Wi-Fi will automatically turn off your Wi-Fi. Auto Wi-Fi uses geofencing (a virtual geological fence based on cellular stations) to detect a user's location. In registered geofenced areas, \"ENTER\" and \"EXIT\" events will be triggered based on location changes detected via the user's device. Since Auto Wi-Fi is only triggered when these events take place, the device does not have to constantly scan for location, thereby saving battery life. Samsung's original cell-based geofencing technique allows users to use Auto Wi-Fi without turning GPS on. Samsung's geofencing technique also incorporates learning algorithms which improves location accuracy over time as users continue to use it. 3. Suspicious Hotspot Detection One of the most common forms of Wi-Fi attacks is through suspicious hotspots. These hotspots appear on the scan list, often with names (SSIDs) similar to other legitimate access points (APs). In actuality, these hotspots capture all transmitted packets or attempt to manipulate the packets to their advantage. Offered in the Galaxy S10 and later models such as the Galaxy Note 10, Detect Suspicious Network is a client-based solution that has been designed to protect our customers from these attacks. The technology detects potentially suspicious hotspots by analyzing traffic patterns on a given network. Upon connecting to potentially suspicious APs, an instant warning message will pop up. Since our technology is based on real-time pattern analysis and not databases, it can also detect hotspots that may change their names continuously. 4. Enhanced Power Saving Wi-Fi data usage on mobile devices has been growing at 67% CAGR, and almost 90% of mobile phone data is consumed over Wi-Fi. The increasing Wi-Fi traffic is generating demand for more advanced power saving techniques to increase battery life. Currently, power saving techniques attempt to reduce power consumption mainly by transferring large data files requiring high-speed throughput, such as movie and video files, through a broadband Wi-Fi network. This, however, may not be suitable for more widely used Wi-Fi applications such as VoIP, Web Browsing, video and audio streaming, live broadcasting, gaming, and SNS. This is because legacy techniques do not consider the real usage of throughput, latency, and bit rate required for various applications and services. To address this problem, intelligent Wi-Fi provides Enhanced Power Saving. Enhanced Power Saving techniques can reduce power consumption while using various data services through Wi-Fi network. It enables lower power consumption by changing the power saving scheme based on real-time traffic pattern analysis during use of various network applications over Wi-Fi. This technique is compatible with WFA-certified APs. In order to minimize current power consumption, the Enhanced Power Saving technology keeps monitoring data traffic patterns and adaptively determines the optimal timing to enter power saving mode and when to wake up without degradation of service quality (i.e. throughput and latency performances). It offers an intelligent, real-time analysis of data transactions over Wi-Fi, including the bit rate, frequency and interval of Tx and Rx packets. Enhanced Power Saving can reduce power consumption up to 50%, 75% for user applications that utilize a Wi-Fi network.",

            "content": "Device is locked with 'Workspace License Expired' error after migrating from a Knox Workspace to an Android Enterprise profile. You may encounter an issue where your device is locked with a Workspace License Expired error. User actions are limited to powering the device on and off or factory resetting it. Cause During the device enrollment process to a UEM, a KLM license key is activated for Knox Workspace deployments, which grants Knox Premium permissions for creating and managing a Knox Workspace. The license activation process creates an association between the device and the license key, and grants the device a set of permissions. Periodic checks are made between the device and licensing server to verify that its assigned seat is still in use. If the device does not check in to the server for 180 days or more, its seat is automatically released and all permissions previously granted to the device are revoked. During the migration process from a Knox Workspace deployment to AE Device Owner mode, some UEMs may also activate an ELM key. The ELM key grants devices Knox Standard permissions for access to APIs offered by the Knox Standard SDK. When activating an ELM key, the UEM inherits all the permissions granted on the previous license activation by the same UEM client. An unintended consequence of this activation is the device upgrading to Device Owner Premium mode, which requires a paid KLM\\* license key. However, the Knox Premium permissions are not granted because the KLM license key may have expired. Consequently, the device may be locked with the Workspace License Expired error. There may be other causes related to this issue, which the Samsung Knox team is currently investigating. *The KLM license key has become the KPE license key. Please refer to the Knox licenses page to learn more about license types. Workaround To avoid encountering this error, the association between device and server must be removed on both sides. Before factory resetting a device, re-enrolling it in a UEM, or uninstalling a UEM client, ensure you have followed these instructions on how to disassociate a device from a KPE license key. If your device(s) are locked after migrating to AE: 1. Disassociate your old license key using the Device Deactivation tool. 2. On the affected device(s), perform a factory reset. 3. Re-enroll the device(s) to the MDM/UEM solution. If you have not been provided with a KPE license key, please submit a ticket through the Knox Admin Portal.

            "content": "Password compliance check returning the wrong result on device. You may encounter an issue where your managed devices perform a password compliance check and return the wrong result, causing them to be quarantined. Cause This is a known issue impacting only FDE-based devices. If the password requirements are changed after the device is booted up, the current password will no longer meet the requirements. Due to changes introduced in Android P, the API that checks if the active password is sufficient may return an incorrect value before the password is entered on a device for the first time. isActivePasswordSufficient() will only return the last known state of password sufficiency. If the password requirement is changed before the user unlocks the device for the first time, the value returned by isActivePasswordSufficient() will not reflect the new password requirement until the user locks and unlocks the device. Resolution This behavior is by design. To avoid compromising your potentially sensitive data, the full set of active password metrics is not stored on your device. Workaround #For IT admins Please consult with your UEM provider for further information on how they have implemented the password sufficiency policy. #For UEMs To handle this password compliance issue, the Device Policy Manager (DPM) can take one of three actions: 1. Postpone updating the password requirement until the user locks and unlocks the phone for the first time. 2. Skip updating altogether if the password requirement will not change. 3. Simply disregard the value of isActivePasswordSufficient() during the window of time when the password requirement is being modified.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "File-based encryption (FBE) and full-disk encryption (FDE). This article provides a general overview of how full-disk encryption (FDE) and file-based encryption (FBE) work, as well as instructions on how to check if your device uses FDE or FBE. Per Google Android Compatibility Program's requirements, devices launched with Android 10.0 or higher are required to use file-based encryption. What is full-disk encryption (FDE)? FDE was introduced in Android 4.4 to provide users with the option to encrypt the entire User Data partition at the Flash Block level. For devices launching with Android 7.0 or higher, the User Data partition is encrypted by default. To meet industry and government security requirements, Samsung Knox builds upon FDE to enhance the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) implementation, taking advantage of hardware security mechanisms and the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Samsung Galaxy devices. On FDE-based Android devices, all user data is encrypted using AES-256-XTS or AES-256-CBC (depending on the device) with a randomly generated encryption key, also known as the Primary Key. Once a device is encrypted, all data created by the user is automatically encrypted before being committed to disk and decrypted during the read process. When the user boots up the device for the first time (for example, following a factory reset), the 256-bit Primary Key is randomly generated and encrypted in storage by the TEE-based Keymaster component. This component uses keys derived from a default password and a device-unique hardware based key to protect against offline attacks. If the user sets a PIN, password, or pattern on the device, and configures Secure Startup via Settings > Biometrics and Security, the Primary Key is re-encrypted by the Keymaster using the user's credentials and stored. If Secure Startup is not enabled after being configured, the Primary Key is re-encrypted using the default password instead of the user's credentials. During subsequent device reboots, the Primary Key is recovered using either the default password or the user's credentials, depending on whether Secure Startup was configured, allowing the system to mount the user data partition and decrypt its data while it is read from Flash memory. Changing the user credentials on the device does not re-encrypt the user data. Instead, the Primary Key is re-encrypted with the new password. What is file-based encryption (FBE)? Available on all Samsung Galaxy devices shipping with Android 9.0 or higher and Knox 3.3 or higher, FBE protects files in the user data Flash partition. Each file is independently encrypted using AES-256-XTS, with a unique File Encryption Key that is derived from a Primary Key. In FBE, Primary Keys are randomly generated and protected by the TEE-based Keymaster component, similar to the FDE implementation. Devices that launched with Android versions before version 9 continue to use FDE even after upgrading to Android 10 through a maintenance release. FBE also introduced a new feature called Direct Boot, which lets encrypted devices boot straight to the lock screen. This feature allows for extended functionality over FDE-based devices, which require the user to enter their credentials before the OS boots and any user data is accessed. If the user chooses not to enter their credentials, the device is unable to receive phone calls and alarms are prevented from functioning. FBE-based devices allow certain apps to be aware of their encryption and run with limited functionality enabled through the use of two storage locations: 1. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage is only available after the user enters their credentials and unlocks the device. 2. Device Encrypted (DE) storage is accessible during Direct Boot mode, as well as after the user unlocks the device. This change to device encryption provides a more flexible data protection scheme. Different areas of the user data file system are protected by their own Primary Keys that are derived from different credentials. Separate Primary Keys are generated for CE and DE storage, with CE Primary Keys using both the device-unique hardware key and the user credentials, and DE keys protected using only the device-unique hardware based key. Since the DE storage area is not bound to the user's credentials, this storage is made available upon device reboot, allowing Direct Boot-aware applications to function before the user unlocks the device. For example, this allows phone calls to be received immediately after startup even before the user unlocks the device. This flexibility also allows work profiles to be protected using a set of Primary Keys separate from personal device data storage. How do I check if my device uses FDE or FBE? To check if your device uses FDE or FBE: 1. On your device, navigate to Settings > Biometrics and security. 2. In the Biometrics and security menu, check if the Secure startup menu exists or not. If Secure startup is available, your device uses FDE. If Secure startup is unavailable, your device uses FBE.

As of February 2023, this issue has been resolved for Knox Platform for Enterprise Standard and Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium licenses, as automatic license assignment release no longer applies for licenses with unlimited assignments. Some users are encountering an issue where their device is locked with a Workspace License Expired error. User actions are limited to powering the device on and off or factory resetting it. Cause When a device is enrolled in an UEM, a KLM key and ELM key are activated for AE DO Premium deployments. This license activation process creates an association between the device and the license key, granting the device a specific set of permissions. The KLM key grants Knox Premium permissions for creating a fully-managed device. Periodic checks are made between the device and Knox license server to verify that its assigned seat is still in use. If the device does not check in to the server for 180 days or more, its seat is automatically released and all permissions previously granted to the device are revoked. After the automatic seat release is triggered, the device is flagged as deactivated in the Knox server. If it is then rebooted, a server check attempts to validate the KLM and ELM license keys associated with the device. However, due to a network timing issue, these validation processes are out-of-sync. As a result, the device is given Knox standard permissions rather than Knox Premium permissions, which locks the workspace container. Resolution The Samsung Knox team has identified a fix for the validation logic, to be released in upcoming Android 9 (P) and 10 (Q) firmware updates. Workaround #For Android 10 (Q OS) Workspace-only devices: Please keep the device connected to a power source and network for at least 24 hours, allowing the device to revalidate the license key to the Knox license server. If the device has already been rebooted, a device factory reset is required to restore the device. #For Android 9 (P OS) and earlier Workspace-only devices: Please keep the device connected to a power source and network for at least 24 hours to ensure that the device has revalidated its associated Knox license. You can also follow the steps outlined below to validate the license: 1. On the device, reboot until the device password screen appears. 2. Enter the device password, after which the \"Workspace License Expired\" error appears. 3. Wait approximately 10 minutes to establish a connection to the Knox licensing server. 4.

Some users are reporting that their devices, enrolled in DO mode, are prompted to factory reset when the associated KPE license expires or is deactivated. Cause In the event that a KPE license expires on a device enrolled in Profile Owner (PO) mode, the work profile is removed without requiring a factory reset. However, in DO mode, the work profile is equivalent to the device and cannot be removed as in PO mode. To ensure the device removes all activity associated with the work profile, it must be factory reset. If a new KPE license is associated with the device after it is prompted to factory reset, its work data and profile are restored. Resolution This is an expected behavior of the work profile. After the KPE license associated with a device in DO mode expires or is deactivated, and the device is then powered off or rebooted, a factory reset is required to ensure that the work profile is fully removed. Workaround To avoid encountering the factory reset prompt, please check the expiry dates of your KPE licenses and ensure you renew them before they expire. To do so: 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. 2. On the Licenses page, click Manage license keys. 3. In the Check license keys field, enter your KPE license key. Your KPE license details, including your license's expiry dates, appear in a text box. For more information about KPE licenses, see Knox Platform for Enterprise licenses.",

ApnSettingsPolicy: createApnSettings: -1 ``` The ApnSettings object passed as a parameter to the method also has its mvno_type field set as a string value that is not: empty string, MVNO_SPN, MVNO_IMSI, MVNO+GID Cause There are two reasons for the invalid MVNO type error: 1. From Knox API Level 29 (Knox version 3.4/Android P), ApnSettings.mvno_type and ApnSettings.mvno_value are required fields. If the APN does not require a MVNO type and value, you must enter empty strings in the MVNO type and value fields. 2.

Resolution For customers to be able to configure or update their APN Settings, ensure the conditions below are met: 1. On devices running Knox 3.4 and higher, your UEM partner must update their implementation to support the mvno_type and mvno_value fields in the ApnSettings class. For details, please refer to the Knox SDK documentation. 2. The customer must update the firmware containing the fix that allows the MVNO type and value to be set with the Knox SDK.

This is enabled so the user can transfer their personal data to and from the device. Fully Managed Devices can enable Smart Switch via managed app configurations, but by default is restricted for security reasons. For Android 10 and below using a Fully Managed Device with a Work Profile enrolment method, you can use KSP to enable SS on the personal side with these steps: 1. Go to Device-wide policies > Device Restrictions. 2. Set Enable device restriction controls to Enable. 3. Set Allow Smart Switch to Enable. How do I enable Smart Switch using Managed App Configurations? The following are general EMM steps to enable Smart Switch on Fully Managed Devices. Please consult your EMM's documentation on how to use Managed App Configurations for vendor-specific steps. 1. In your EMM console, go to the Apps management area. 2. Find the Samsung Smart Switch mobile app and edit its properties. 3. In the managed app configuration section, enable the Allow Smart Switch Run option configuration. 4. Save and publish the changes to your devices. 5. On the device, launch Smart Switch. The warning message no longer appears and Smart Switch is allowed to open.",

Users may find that the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) cannot be uninstalled from a device or deactivated as a Device admin under: Settings > Biometrics and Security > Other security settings > Device admin apps > Knox Service Plugin. If KSP is installed on a device and no policies have been pushed through managed configuration from the UEM's console, the app may still be uninstallable in certain cases. However, once any policies have been applied to the device through KSP, KSP is made a Device Admin and becomes uninstallable. This behavior is intentional because if KSP were to be removed after applying policies, the device would no longer have the ability to revoke any of the previously applied policies. Workaround To remove KSP from a device, it must be factory reset (for Fully Managed, Fully Managed with Work Profile, or Work Profile on Company-owned devices), or the Work Profile must be deleted. An additional alternative is to leave KSP installed on the device but configure an empty configuration from the UEM console so that no policies are actually applied.

            "content": "Certificates missing after updating Samsung devices to Android 12. In Q3 2021, Keystore, Android's cryptographic key storage system, was redesigned and implemented as Keystore2. In an effort to harmonize with Google and the modernization of Android, Samsung deprecated its Knox TIMA Keystore and client certificate manager systems used on Samsung devices in favor of Keystore2. New Samsung devices that come pre-installed with Android 12 and existing Samsung devices upgrading to Android 12 now use Keystore2. When you upgrade Samsung devices enrolled with a work profile from Android 11 to Android 12, after the certificate keystore migration process, an app loses access to its certificates. Since there are no reliable software fixes to this unintended side effect, this article provides a manual workaround. Cause Microsoft Endpoint Manager uses Android Management API as an underlying device management technology. Currently, the Android Management API model doesn't have a way of auto granting an app's access to Keystore2. Therefore, when you upgrade Samsung devices from Android 11 to Android 12, Samsung's keystore and client certificate manager systems fail to migrate to Keystore2, and causes deployed apps to lose access to the stored certificates. Resolutions After upgrading your Samsung devices from Android 11 to Android 12, remove and redeploy the impacted certificates or app configuration to the devices. The required steps differ based on how the devices are enrolled. #Personally-owned devices with work profiles First, uninstall the affected app. Then, reinstall it based on its assignment type: Available app - Instruct the device user to manually reinstall the app from Managed Google Play private. Required app - The app reinstalls automatically. #Fully managed devices, company-owned devices with work profiles, and dedicated devices First, uninstall the affected app. Then, reinstall it based on its assignment type: Available app - Instruct the device user to manually uninstall and reinstall the app from Managed Google Play private. Required app - Deploy a policy to remove and reinstall the app. Follow these steps provided by Microsoft support: 1. In the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, create an exclusion group for the affected app. 2. Add the affected user accounts to the exclusion group. 3. Sync the policy to the Android devices. 4. Verify that the affected app is removed from the devices. 5. Remove the user accounts from the exclusion group. 6. Confirm the app is added to the devices. Please contact your Microsoft representative if the issue continues to persist after the redeployment of the impacted app configuration. If you have any questions, reply to Microsoft's notice about this issue or reach out to Microsoft Intune Support @IntuneSuppTeam on Twitter.

After the VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae Intelligent Hub update to v22.11, some users encountered an issue where the device is locked with the error: `Workspace License Expired` Cause Previously with versions lower than v22.11, VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae Intelligent Hub would activate Samsung's Enterprise License Management (ELM) license key. The ELM key grants access to Knox Standard license features. Additionally, users or other third-party apps can activate the KLM or EE Legacy license for access to Knox Premium features. In this case, and for other apps that activate legacy ELM, KLM, or EE license keys, these keys grant permissions to the VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae Intelligent Hub that allow it to enable access to Knox Premium features. Starting with VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae Intelligent Hub v22.11, the ELM license key activation was replaced with the Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) Standard key. Activating the KPE Standard license causes the Knox Premium permissions to be revoked, causing the device to unintentionally lock and display the error `Workspace License Expired`. As of October 2018, Samsung replaced the ELM license key with the KPE Standard key. To improve security measures, the KPE Standard key provides access to app-specific permissions instead of device-wide permissions. Resolution If a device is locked and shows the Workspace License Expired error, it can only be restored through a factory reset. For devices that are at risk of being locked by the KPE Standard license, activating a KPE Premium license key will avert this issue. If the VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae Intelligent Hub activates a KPE Premium key on the device instead of a KPE Standard key, the device will not lose the Knox Premium permissions and will remain unlocked. Before activating the KPE Premium key, ensure that the KLM Legacy license (KLM03~) or EE legacy license (KLM07~) is currently activated. To check if there is an active legacy key: 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Click Licenses to view your licenses. To generate and activate the KPE Premium key in the VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae UEM console: 1. Generate a free KPE Premium license key. 2. Enter your KPE Premium license key in the VMware Workspace ONE\u00ae UEM console to unlock the device.

Google Play system updates can force software updates to specific system components. When the System Update policy is enabled and set to Automatic on the EMM profile, the updates can begin at unpredictable times, causing the issue. Mainline updates are separate from Android Security Maintenance Releases (SMRs) and Android version updates. These updates occur independently. Resolution There are several methods to prevent unexpected mainline updates: Disable the System Update policy on the device. Postpone all updates on the device with the System Update policy. Configure an update maintenance window with the System Update policy. The exact steps to update the System Update policy are different for each EMM. Please consult your EMM's documentation for more details. Knox E-FOTA can schedule updates for SMRs and Android version updates, but not mainline updates. If you configure the System Update policy through your EMM, you can pause mainline updates. With this policy in combination with Knox E-FOTA, you can manage all three types of system updates. To disable the System Update policy: 1. On your EMM, go to the Android Enterprise configuration. 2. Ensure System > System Update is left unconfigured. 3. Save and apply your changes to the affected devices. To postpone updates with the System Update policy: 1. On your EMM, go to the Android Enterprise configuration. 2. Modify the following policy: System > System Update - Postpone , Freeze Period - Select start and end dates for when you want to prevent updates. 3. Click + to add the configuration. 4. Save and apply your changes to the affected devices. Updates can only be postponed for 30 days. After 30 days, the device user is prompted to update and restart the device. To configure an update maintenance window with the System Update policy: 1. On your EMM, go to the Android Enterprise configuration. 2. Modify the following policy: System > System Update - Windowed , Schedule (Start - End Time) - Enter the start and end times for the software update. Freeze Period - Select the start and end date for when you want to prevent updates. 3. Click + to add the configuration. 4. Save and apply your changes to the affected devices. If the device continues to reboot, submit a support ticket.

Settings Problem Resolution Dual DAR Dual DAR is not working on my devices. You must meet the following requirements to use Dual DAR. Devices should support Dual DAR 1.1 version or higher (check by going to Device Settings &gt; About phone &gt; Software information &gt; Knox version) , Only works for fully managed device with a work profile deployments for the encryption of Work Profiles within the managed devices , You must use Knox Mobile Enrollment(KME) 1.23 or higher version to enroll the devices. See the following release notes for more information setting up Dual DAR with KME. NOTE: KSP does not initiate Dual DAR, it only helps activate a KPE Premium Dual DAR license. You configure the parameters after it is setup during enrollment by KME. Devices set up with File Based Encryption (FBE) KSP does not receive policies pushed to devices that are set up with File-based encryption (FBE) This can occur only if a device is rebooted and has not yet been unlocked. The user must unlock the mobile device with their chosen authentication in order to decrypt it. Once this is done, the KSP policies are pushed to the device. Device restrictions or advanced restrictions Native UEM policies should take precedence over KSP policies. If your UEM console natively supports a policy. You should use it instead of the KSP equivalent. This can help avoid unpredictable behavior on the device. If a KSP policy is used, the value may be overridden by your UEM in future deployment, depending on how you have set up your deployment schedule. Example: if your UEM console supports disable NFC and KSP also supports disable NFC, use the native UEM console policy. Multifactor authentication (2FA) and biometrics A conflict between multifactor authentication (2FA) and Biometric policies can cause a device to become \"Admin locked.\" When this occurs, the user can't unlock the device without admin assistance. This can occur if you turn off biometric unlock before you turn off 2FA. To avoid Admin Lock: When you activate 2FA on a device, turn on your biometric policy first (iris or fingerprint). While 2FA is enabled and running on a device, do not independently disable your biometric policy (iris or fingerprint). When you are turning off 2FA, make sure you follow this order of logic. Disable 2FA Disable biometric unlock We also strongly recommend you disable One Lock on devices where 2FA is used for Work Profile authentication. One Lock policies are supported by your native UEM console and outside the scope of KSP. NOTE: 2FA only works with Iris and Fingerprint (FP) only. Face recognition is independent and is not linked to 2FA. DeX Customization features not working DeX Customization error messages are not showing up in debug mode. Many DeX Customization features do not return errors (regardless of debug mode or normal operation). If your device has correct OS and DeX version then these will be applied, if not they will be ignored. To see the debug messages, use a device with a version of Knox that supports the DeX features you are using. Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan) Certificate based authentication with a Device Owner (DO) does not work with Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan). No resolution. Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan) does not support certificate based authentication when deployed to a DO device. Dual SIM KSP is currently able to restrict operations on the second SIM but is unable to hide the second SIM's UI on the device. No resolution. The current implementation does not block the UI, however, it restricts calls, SMS, MMS, and data connections using internal radio layer APIs on the second SIM's internal.",

            "content": "Device orphaned from EMM after failed factory reset. When a device is managed by an EMM and Knox Service Plugin, the admin can configure the Allow Factory Reset Knox Service Plugin policy to prevent the device from being wiped accidentally. However, if the policy is set to Disable and the admin issues a wipe or delete command to the device, rather than wiping the device, the EMM inadvertently unenrolls the device and its policies remain. The device then enters an orphaned state where it remains restricted, and neither the admin nor the device user is unable to remove those restrictions. Cause Before delivering a wipe or delete command to a device, not all EMMs check the Knox Service Plugin configuration. As a result, the device can't be factory reset due to the Knox Service Plugin configuration, and is removed from the EMM console. Devices enrolled in Knox Manage don't encounter this issue, as Knox Manage checks the Knox Service Plugin configuration before proceeding with a reset. Workaround Before you wipe a device through your EMM, ensure that the Allow Factory Reset policy is set to Enable. To change this policy: 1. On the EMM console, go to the Knox Service Plugin configuration. 2. Modify the following policy: Device-wide policies > Device Restrictions > Allow Factory Reset - Enable. 3. Save and apply your changes to the affected devices. If this issue has occurred and the devices are restricted, contact your regional Samsung's customer service center.",
