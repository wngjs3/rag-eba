Knox Asset Intelligence provides integrated Knox Service Plugin (KSP) information on the dashboard to help you monitor the deployment status of your KSP policies. By default, the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) status tile is disabled on your dashboard. You can enable it in the dashboard settings. Every time KSP data is updated through an EMM solution, the KSP agent passes it to the Knox Asset Intelligence agent on the device, which in turn uploads the data to the server within 24 hours. On the Knox Asset Intelligence console, you can view or download a policy report or the full policy schema to help you troubleshoot KSP-related issues on your devices. Main tile view The KSP dashboard tile shows you how many of your devices have KSP installed, which profiles were successfully applied, and which profiles failed to apply. Expanded view The expanded view contains a list of devices with KSP installed, as well as the following information: DEVICE ID - The unique identifier of the device. DEVICE GROUP - The name of the group the device belongs to. KSP APP VERSION - The KSP version currently installed on the device.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Apply basic policies. Before setting any policies, ensure you have met the following prerequisites. Refer to your UEM documentation for instructions on how to complete these steps. 1. Your devices are set up in either a DO or PO deployment mode. 2. You have set up a Managed Google Play store. 3. You have added KSP as an approved app. Set a standard policy #Device Owner (DO) This example demonstrates how to use a device-wide (DO) policy that requires a fingerprint as the minimum password strength. This configuration is applied to the entire device. You can repeat this sequence of steps for any policy that falls under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Device Wide Policy Controls. 2. Under Password policy turn on Enable password policy controls with KSP. 3. Under Biometric authentication turn on Enable fingerprint authentication. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 5. Your policies are now applied. #Profile Owner (PO) This example demonstrates how to use a profile-wide policy that disables the Android Allow Share Via feature. The particular policies used in this section require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. You can repeat this step sequence for any policy under the Work profile policies (Profile Owner) category. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Work profile policies (Profile Owner) category, turn on Enable work profile policy controls. 2. Under Device Restrictions turn on Enable device restriction controls. 3. If required, enter your Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium License Key. If your UEM natively supports Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license activation, you don't need to fill out this field. Check with your UEM for more information. 4. Disable Allow Share Via option. 5. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 6. Your policies are now applied. Here is an example of a success message and an error message. The error message occurs if you try to apply a Premium policy to a device without first activating a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. Set multiple policy parameters Some policies allow you to select more than one option as a parameter. With these policies, you can individually select which parameters to enable or disable. In some cases, you may need to deselect policy parameters that you do not want to apply. For example, we set the USB exception list to allow only Audio and Human Interface Device. The following image shows a policy with multiple options applied. To revoke multiple polices, simply deselect the polices you want to change and push the updated configuration profile to your devices. Set group policies Some policies are actually a subset of a larger group policy. With these policies, you must enable the group policy before you can modify any individual parameters. For example, we must first turn on Tethering controls before we can access the Allow Wi-Fi tethering and Allow Bluetooth tethering settings. The following image illustrates these settings. Target a specific app To target a specific app, you need to use the app package name in conjunction with a KSP policy. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Enable application management controls. 2. Under Application Management policies, enable Enable application management controls with KSP. 3. Under Battery optimization insert the app package name you want to target, for example, `com.samsung.email.provider`. If you want to add more than one app, enter a comma separated list of package names, for example `com.samsung.email.provider, com.samsung.android.app.notes, com.sec.android.app.voicenote`. If you need to remove an app from a previously applied policy, simply remove the app package from your comma separated list and re-apply the configuration. One way to find an app's package is to search for it on Google Play in a browser. You see the app package appended to the URL in the browser, as seen in the following image. Enforce a password policy The first line of defense on a device is a strong device password. KSP offers granular controls for IT admins to enforce the use of a strong password as well as allow or block other authentication methods on a device. For example, let's turn off biometric authentication methods for devices as well as enforce a specific password policy. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, next to Password Policy, click Configure. 2. On the Password Policy page that opens, set the Enable password policy controls with KSP field to True. 3. Next to the Biometric authentication field, click Configure. 4. On the Biometric authentication page that opens, set all fields to False. Doing so turns off all biometric authentication methods for these devices. Return to the Password policy page. 5. Next to the Password Change field, click Configure. 6. On the page that opens, set the Enforce password change field to True. When you set the Enforce password change field to True, the device user is forced to set up a password - if one was not already set up - or change the password, if a password was previously set on the device. 7. In the Password enforcement timeout field, set a value for the number of minutes up to which the user can cancel or delay the password change. We recommend setting a low value to enforce a password change in a timely fashion. Return to the Password policy page. 8. Next to the Password Restrictions field, click Configure. 9. In the Maximum character sequence length field, set the maximum length of an alphabetic sequence that is allowed for a password. 10. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. Your policy is now updated. Revoke a policy Revoking a policy is simple. All you need to do is find the policy you previously enabled and toggle it back off. For example, let's turn Wi-Fi back on from our previous example. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Device Wide Policy Controls. 2. Find the previous policy you disabled, for example Allow Wi-Fi. 3. Turn Allow Wi-Fi back on. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 5. Your policy is now updated. #Revoke a group of policies You can also revoke an entire group of polices if you turn off the respective group control flag. For example, if you turn off Enable device restriction controls, then all device restrictions are revoked. In addition, if a policy that is related to a configuration is disabled, all the configuration is revoked. For example, if Customize DeX Experience is turned off , then all settings applied from the DeX customization profile are revoked. Test and debug policies To test your polices, you use a feature called Debug mode. 1. Turn on Debug mode. 2. Set or update the policies you need. 3. Push the policies to a device. 4. Check the KSP app for debug information. Tips on successful KSP deployments 1. Deploy payloads gradually. 2. Add only a small number of policy changes at a time. Push , Test , Ensure success 3. Disable debug mode in production after testing. 4. Assign unique profile names in KSP. Settings can be configured in 2 main areas - the Device wide policies (DO and WP-C) and the Work profile policies (PO). The sections below these DO and PO configurations are sub sections of the policy, and usually need to be enabled in the DO or PO prior to being configured in the policy. Inside of each section of the policy, there are typically switches that turn on individual settings. During configuration, make sure not to navigate back in your web browser, or you will lose your progress. If the EMM console splits into different sections, use the navigation controls inside the EMM to navigate. Navigation specifics vary based on your EMM.",

Knox Service Plugin is an app that lets you use Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) features to administer, configure, and secure Samsung devices, as soon as the features are available through a Knox Platform for Enterprise release. As an IT admin, you are able to use the latest Knox features on the day they are launched, instead of needing to develop your own solution using the Samsung Knox SDK, or waiting for your UEM provider to integrate the features. Why use Knox Service Plugin? Here's a simple example to explain how Knox Service Plugin can help you: Let's say that Knox Platform for Enterprise introduces the capability for Samsung devices to translate speech to any language in real time. James, an IT admin for his global organization, thinks that would be a very useful feature to deploy to his team's devices, but his team doesn't include a software developer to make use of the Knox SDK to incorporate the feature. James contacts a developer at his UEM provider, Leonard, to ask when the new feature might be integrated into the UEM's console. Leonard tells James that the new feature won't be included in their UEM console for many months. Undeterred, James remembers that he doesn't need to wait for Leonard to implement the new feature. Instead, he can add the Knox Service Plugin app to his UEM. With the plugin installed, new features introduced in Knox Platform for Enterprise are available in his UEM console the same day, and James can enable the translation feature on his team's devices right away. Benefits of using Knox Service Plugin Knox Service Plugin lets IT admins use Knox Platform for Enterprise features as soon as they're available. Knox Platform for Enterprise brings defense-grade security on the most popular consumer devices across all enterprises. It provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features in Android. Knox is the cornerstone of a strong mobile security strategy supporting a wide variety of Samsung devices. Knox Service Plugin provides the following benefits: Helps enterprise customers deploy existing and new Knox features to their devices almost instantly after features are commercially launched. Leverages the UEM's framework and UI to offer enterprise customers better control over distribution and configuration of Knox Platform for Enterprise features. Makes sure all Knox Platform for Enterprise features are available for use, regardless of which UEM you choose. Minimizes a UEM's development cost of supporting Knox Platform for Enterprise features.",

These policies are listed under DO > DeX policy > Manage DeX restrictions. Customization controls - These additional customization options allow you to change the DeX setup and user experience. Use of these policies requires a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Enable DeX The process to enable DeX is simple and only requires you to turn on a few policies as follows: 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. To disable DeX, simply turn off Allow DeX connection, as shown in the previous example. Enable DeX with basic customization This example shows you how to enable DeX so it auto-launches and sets a specific screen timeout. Note that all DeX customization policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under DeX customization profile, enable Auto-start DeX on HDMI connection. 5. Under DeX customization profile, find Set screen timeout and input your desired value. 6. Under DeX customization profile, disable Allow screen timeout change. 7. The device now launches DeX automatically when it is plugged in to an HDMI cable. 8. Once the device is connected to DeX, a Display resolution screen displays. Select a single resolution value for the connected display. Unselected display options will be greyed out and unavailable. Keep in mind, changing the resolution makes displayed windows, text and other items appear small or larger. Options include, WQHD (2560 x 1440), FHD (1920 x 1080) _recommended setting_, HD+ (1600 x 900), WQXGA (2560 x 1600), WUXGA (1920 x 1200), or UWQHD (3440 x 1440). Select Done to commit the selected display setting. If the display resolution provided is not supported, then FHD (1920 x 1080) is selected by default and non-supported resolutions are greyed out in the DeX Display resolution screen. Industry example This example configures a tablet in DeX mode, so a bank employee can use it to help customers with day to day operations. For example opening a new account or checking account balances. In this use case, DeX is used as a dedicated employee work station and the bank can slowly phase out older, single-purpose computer terminals. These instructions do not apply to any specific UEM. Refer to your UEM documentation for specific instructions on menu structure and navigation. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under DeX Policy, turn on Enable DeX policy controls. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Customize DeX Experience. 5. Set the DeX profile name to an appropriate value. For example, the following image shows a profile called Bank Terminal. 6. Under DeX customization profile, type the name of the DeX Profile you set in the previous step. In this example, it is Bank Terminal 7. Under DeX customization profile, enable DeX Auto Start on HDMI connection This setting minimizes potential troubleshooting for employees and can reduce IT overhead. If a device is unplugged, setting up the bank terminal again is as simple as plugging the device back in to an HDMI cable. 8. Under DeX customization profile, enable Disable buttons on the DeX panel. Select the buttons you want to disable. For example, selecting Exit DeX button prevents users from exiting the bank terminal and using the device for other purposes. 9. Under DeX customization profile, turn on Skip overscan detection screen. The overscan screen is a setting that automatically tries to optimize the UI according to the monitor you are using. This setting is unnecessary for this use-case. 10. Under DeX customization profile, enable Add application shortcuts on DeX. You can now add relevant bank services that employees need to use to the DeX homescreen. To do add apps, list the app packages in the App package name dialog. 11. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 12. Once configured and pushed to a device, DeX auto launches with your company profile and policies applied. DeX Customization features do not always return errors in debug mode. This omission can happen if your device may not have the correct OS or DeX version installed. If the framework on your device does not support your policies, then they are not applied.",

The Device Configuration Policy Properties page opens. 2. On the Properties page, in the Settings list, click Configure. The OEMConfig page for the Device Configuration Policy opens. 3. Next to the appropriate Profile Owner or Device Owner field, click Configure. 4. Navigate to one of the following Password Policy fields as needed. Click Configure. Once the updates have been completed, click OK. Updated password settings are saved and deployed to devices based on the deployment schedule. Set the Enable password policy controls with KSP value to True to permit the management of password policies on a device. Enable this option before changing any of the device's password settings. If this option is not set to True, then any password or user authentication settings are ignored. Refer to the following Biometric authentication options to use personal traits (fingerprints, iris, and facial recognition) as device user authenticators. Consider biometric authenticators as an alternative to traditional passwords that are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing attempts and duplication. Enable fingerprint authentication - Set this value to True to permit the use of fingerprint recognition as a device user authenticator. Enable Iris authentication - Set this value to True to permit the use of an iris as a device user authenticator. Iris scanning measures the unique patterns in the human iris (the colored circles in the eye). The iris scanner then creates a digital representation of the data and store it in a database for potential use as a user authenticator. Enable Face recognition - Set this value to True to utilize a digital image of a device user's face as an authenticator. An authentication request matches the user's facial image with the image stored in the database before device access is granted. If a lock is set in DO and it is using P/P/P authentication, the user should not be able to use facial authentication in PO. Set the Enable multifactor authentication value to True to enable multifactor authentication (2FA), enforcing a device unlock only after two successful authentication methods are provided. If enabling multifactor authentication, one authentication method must be biometric (fingerprint, iris, or face), and the other must be a lock screen method (PIN, password, or pattern). Multifactor authentication is only supported on Knox 3.2.1 and above devices. Keep in mind, the incorrect use of multifactor authentication with \"One lock\" and a biometric policy could result in a locked device requiring qualified support assistance to unlock. Refer to the following Password change options to enforce how device users set their login password and the interval it is changed: Set the Enforce Password Change value to True to force the user to change their password the next time they login to their device. If no password has been set, use this option to force the user to create a password. Verify existing password enforcement conditions before setting this value to True to ensure password enforcement changes do not occur at an unexpected time. If unsure, set this value to False. Configure a Password Enforcement timeout \\ to define the maximum number of minutes a device user can wait to cancel or delay a password change. Refer to the following Policy Restriction settings to manage various password complexity characteristics: Set the Maximum Character Sequence Length \\ to define the maximum alphanumeric character sequence permitted for a device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on alphanumeric sequence length. Set the Maximum Numeric Sequence Length \\ to specify the maximum numeric sequence length permitted for a device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on numeric sequence length. Set the Minimum Password Length \\ to specify the minimum number of characters permitted for the device password. The larger the number, the greater potential strength of the device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction. Define the Allowed Time for User Activity before Device Locks to set the maximum number of milliseconds \\ for user activity before the device will lock. A value of zero (0) means no activity restrictions are in place. Set the Maximum Failed Password Attempts to Wipe Data to define the number of failed password attempts \\ allowed before the data on the device is wiped and rendered unavailable. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on the number of failed login attempts. Keep in mind, the string provided via the API takes effect immediately, with no chance to revert the data once the defined number of password attempts is exceeded. Enter the Maximum Failed Password Attempts to Disable Work Profile to set the number of failed password attempts \\ before the work profile and device itself are disabled. Once disabled, the device user is unable to restore the device with the password, and an administrator must re-enable the device. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on the number of failed login attempts. Refer to the Define Password Quality value to select the level of complexity required when setting a device's work profile password. From No Password to Complex Password (letter, numeric and alphanumeric characters required). A Numeric Complex password must include numeric characters with no repeating or ordered integers. Options include: No Password , Some Password , Numeric , Alphabet , Alphanumeric , Numeric Complex , Complex , Use the Disable Keyguard Feature to select the specific Keyguard feature to disable. Keyguard is the code utilized in a device unlock operation. Options include None and Disable Trusted Agents. Set the Password Visibility control to True to enable the ability to hide the password from view when entered on the device. Setting this control to False disables the ability to hide the password when entered, and provides no additional security.",

KSP provides a group of policies to manage universal authentication credentials in both external and internal device storage, for example, a smartcard, micro SD card, or embedded Secure Element. Depending upon your network and security needs, you can enable or disable UCM policies as well as configure advanced settings for your UCM plugins. Before you can enable UCM plugins for your devices, you must create and configure at least one UCM configuration policy. 1. Create UCM configuration policy The following example describes the process to create a new UCM configuration policy, called Screen lock, that dictates how the UCM plugin restricts access to specific apps on the target device when the device is locked. 1. In your UEM console, open the Device Configuration Profile that is associated with your target devices > click the appropriate option to edit the profile. 2. On the policy settings homepage, next to UCM plugin configurations, click Configure. The page refreshes to show the UCM plugin configurations menu item on the left hand navigation menu. 3.

On the UCM plugin configuration page, do as follows: 1. In the Name of UCM plugin configuration field, enter Screen lock. Always choose a name that highlights the main feature or use of the UCM plugin configuration that you are setting up. You can then reference this name in KSP to apply these settings to the target device. 2. In the Package name of UCM plugin application field, enter the package name for your UCM vendor's application. Sample format is `com.mycompany.ucm.plugin`. Refer to the UCM vendor application's Google Play Store page for the correct package name. 3. In the Credential usage list, select Screen lock. 4. If your UCM vendor's plugin supports PIN caching, in the Pin properties area > in the PIN timeout type list > select Same as screen lock. The UCM plugin now requires re-authentication whenever the screen locks. 5. In the Application access controls area > Type of access restrictions list > select Unrestricted access. 6. In the Access control when device or workspace is locked area > Lock credential storage when device or workspace is locked list > click True. 7. In the List of apps allowed to access credential storage when locked field, enter the package names - in a comma-separated list - to allow specific apps to access UCM credential storage when the device is locked. 8. List of certificates to install on this credential storage after configuration. 5. Click OK to save this new UCM configuration. This UCM configuration restricts all apps' access to UCM credential storage, with the exception of specific apps, when the device is locked. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for each type of UCM configuration policy you want to create in your Device Configuration Profile. 2. Use an existing UCM configuration policy The following example shows you how to use the Screen lock UCM configuration policy that you created earlier to automatically secure target devices in the High security devices device group when the screen is locked. 1. After you've created the Screen lock UCM configuration policy in your chosen Device Configuration Policy, go to Groups > All groups. 2. On the All groups page, confirm that the High security devices device group exists. Refer to your UEM console's help documentation for information on creating a new or editing an existing device group. 3. Go to the Device Configuration Policy that contains the Screen lock UCM configuration policy > click Assignments > Include tab. 4.

            "content": "VPN policies. Configuring and applying VPN policies with KSP is a two step process: To use VPN features on Samsung One UI Core devices, you are required to add the KSP package name `com.samsung.android.knox.kpu` to the certificate allow list using the allow applications to read private keys without alerting user feature in the Certificate Management Policies section. VPN policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. Set up the VPN configuration profile - Choose the VPN settings and policies to suit your organization. These settings are saved as a profile you can reuse in later configurations, such as setting up a DO or PO profile. 2. Create the VPN policy - The VPN Policy uses settings from the VPN configuration profile created in the previous step. This VPN policy allows you to specify other rules, such as which apps should use this VPN. The following example shows you how to configure a per app VPN on a Device Owner (DO) device. Configure VPN profile 1. Under VPN profiles, VPN Profile, enter a profile name. For example, `VPN_Knox`. 2. Under VPN profiles, Vendor, choose the type of VPN you want to use. For this example, we select Knox built-in, which uses the Android VPN Management for Knox VPN. 3. Under Host, list your server host IP, for example, `52.3.256.0`. 4. Leave all other values as default. 5. In your UEM, save the profile. Configure VPN Vendor parameters Now that you have created a VPN profile, you can set up the parameters such as the identifier and pre-shared key. Following the previous example, continue to configure Android VPN Management for Knox VPN. 1. Under Parameters for Knox built-in VPN, Authentication type select `ipsec_ike2_rsa.` 2. Under User certificate alias, enter your certificate name. For example: `md_user.pfx`. 3. Under CA certificate alias, enter your certificate name. For example: `vpn_cal.pfx`. 4. Leave all other values as default. 5. In your UEM, save the profile. If you are using a different VPN, such as Pulse Secure or Cisco AnyConnect, these values may differ. The mandatory parameters you need to set depend on your network configuration. Contact your Network Administrator to find out which fields to use and with what values. Enable VPN policy Now that you have created and configured a profile, configure a policy and push it to a target device. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under VPN policy, turn on Enable VPN controls. 3. Under VPN type, choose Selected Apps (Per-App). Currently, KSP does not support per-app the VPN mode for Net Motion VPN. 4. Under Manage list of apps that use VPN, add the package names of the apps you want to route through the VPN. For example, `com.samsung.email.provider`. If you do not enter any app packages, the VPN applies to all apps by default. 5. Enter the Name of VPN profile to use, for this example we use our Android VPN Management for Knox profile `VPN_Knox`. 6. Leave all the other VPN values as set by default. 7. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. Within the VPN policy, optionally enable USB tethering over VPN so an allow listed USB device can access and share resources with a peer device. Admins can ensure there is security-based certification available so only a designated organization, or user, can use VPN tethering with allowed devices. However, VPN tethering will only work when the following conditions are met: An IT admin must allow this feature from their UEM console for a target device to receive the tethering feature. A user must enable VPN tethering on their device. The laptop or tablet being connected must have been previously allow listed by the IT admin. The maximum number of VPN connections does not exceed 2. USB tethering over VPN is only supported on Knox 3.5 and above devices. A wrong VPN configuration can disconnect your device or work profile from the network, and in some cases render it unrecoverable. To avoid this issue, Samsung recommends keeping the following applications out of the VPN configuration: UEM Agent package - Check with your UEM for details. KSP package - `com.samsung.android.knox.kpu`, Google services - `com.android.vending, com.google.android.gms` Use the Manage list of apps that can bypass VPN setting to list theses packages.",

Samsung devices that support Knox and run Android 9 or higher. 2. A Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solution that supports Android Enterprise deployments and is compatible with KSP. 3. A valid Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) license for each of the devices managed with KSP. For more information about Knox licenses, see Knox Platform for Enterprise licenses. 4. You must set up your devices in one of the supported Android Enterprise deployments, as described in the following section. Supported deployments The first step to deploy a KSP policy is to create a DO or PO profile on your device. Without choosing one or the other, policies do not work and an error message is thrown. In an enterprise deployment, Google provides three modes of Android Enterprise, fully managed (DO), work profile (PO), and fully managed with a work profile. Work Profile - Helps admins manage the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) use case, where a device user owns the device and uses it both personally and for work. The agent sits inside the container area as Profile Owner (PO) to separate work apps from personal apps. IT admins can control the work area only, and have no visibility over or access to the personal area. Managed Device - Also known as Company Owned, Business Only (COBO); helps admins manage devices that are owned by the enterprise. When a device is enrolled as a Managed Device, IT admins have full control over the device. The agent sits as Device Owner (DO) of the device. Work Profile on Company Owned Devices - Also known as Corporate Owned, Managed Profile (COMP) on Android 10, and WP-C (starting Android 11+) are company-owned devices that are personally enabled, with a container that is managed by PO. This deployment type targets enterprise-owned devices that require a separation of work and personal data. Employees can use these devices for either work or personal purposes. For more information, refer to Work profile enhancements for company-owned devices. #KSP works with the following Android Enterprise deployment modes: Android 9.0, 10.0 - Fully managed device - Device Owner (DO), Work Profile - Profile Owner (PO), fully managed device with a Work Profile, and Android dedicated devices (COSU) (Corporate-Owned Single Use) mode. Android 11 and higher - Fully managed device - Device Owner (DO), Work Profile on personally owned devices (PO), Work Profile on company-owned devices (WP-C), and Android dedicated devices (COSU). Refer to your respective EMM configuration guide for information on provisioning dedicated devices (COSU). Supported features Your deployment must use policy configurations that Knox Service Plugin supports. Knox Service Plugin inherits its policies from the Knox Platform for Enterprise framework. These policies can be either standard or premium features. Premium features require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Supported UEMs You need a UEM that supports Android Enterprise based deployments, device management APIs, and complies with the OEMConfig specification. Check with your UEM vendor to confirm which version of the UEM console you need to use with Knox Service Plugin. Some UEMs offer more than one console, and some consoles may not support Knox Service Plugin. For information about configuring UEMs, see Set up with a UEM. All UEM partners continue to support KPE through their console. Customers need to use KSP only if their UEM solution provider does not support a Knox feature they plan to use. For more information, see Which policy should I use if duplicate policies exist?.",

            "content": "How Knox Service Plugin works. This document is intended for: System architects - Understand how Knox Service Plugin works, and how you can use it to customize your deployment of Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE). IT admins - Configure the options available to Knox Platform for Enterprise deployments using Knox Service Plugin. How Knox Service Plugin works Knox Service Plugin is built on top of Android's standard called OEMConfig. OEMConfig is a feature that lets you create and remotely push configurations to apps through an XML schema file that is hosted in an app on Google Play. This architecture means that any UEM that complies with the OEMConfig standard can support Knox Service Plugin. Here is an overview of how Knox Service Plugin works. 1. App developers implement logic to support managed configurations in their apps. They use an XML schema file to define which app settings IT admins can remotely configure in their Android app. This schema is linked to the app's manifest file. After each update, app developers push their app to Managed Google Play. 2. UEM developers pull the managed configuration schemas from apps on Managed Google Play. UEM consoles then use these XML schemas to allow IT admins to specify how they want to configure app settings. After the IT admin saves their configuration, the UEM pushes the configuration to Managed Google Play. 3. Once an app configuration is updated and pushed to Managed Google Play, the app is updated on all applicable devices to reflect the new configuration. The following image is an example of a Knox Service Plugin policy in a UEM console. The implementation, appearance, and menu structure of how these policies look varies depending upon your UEM and its console. For UEM-specific help, refer to your UEM vendor's documentation. Deployment process The Knox Service Plugin deployment process is as follows: 1. Samsung publishes the latest Knox Service Plugin app to Google Play. 2. IT admins use their compatible UEM console - that supports a managed Google Play store - to search for Knox Service Plugin. For a list of UEM partners that support Knox Service Plugin, see Supported UEMs. 3. The UEM Console renders the applicable Knox features and policies using OEMConfig. 4. IT admins use the UEM\"console to set up policies in the form of managed configurations. These policies are then saved and published to any managed enterprise devices. 5. When a user's device is being provisioned, the UEM invokes the managed Google Play Store, which in turn installs Knox Service Plugin and pushes the managed configuration to the device. 6. After installation is complete, Knox Service Plugin runs in the background on the device. Knox Service Plugin applies the relevant Knox policies and returns the result of the configuration process using Google's Feedback SDK. 7. IT admins can view any configuration failures and associated error messages on the UEM Console, provided the UEM is equipped to handle the result that KSP generates and sends back using the feedback SDK.",

            "content": "Schema structure. This section provides an overview of the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) schema structure and general best practices. The following image shows the high level categories of policies and common configurations. It has four main components: 1. Basic elements - General operational controls for KSP. For example, turn on debug mode or input a KPE license key. 2. Device-wide policies section - Device Owner (DO) policy controls. These are of global scope. 3. Work profile policies section - Profile Owner (PO) policy controls. These apply to only the . 4. Configurations - Specific configuration properties that are used in conjunction with policy controls. For example, VPN profile settings, APN settings, or DeX customization settings. These can be used on either device-wide policies or work profile policies. Schema breakdown #Common configurations Each version of Knox Service Plugin includes a few common options. The features available within these options depend upon your Knox Service Plugin deployment mode, Knox Platform for Enterprise license status - whether you have a Standard or a Premium license - as well as the features available on your UEM console. Device key mapping can be supported using either a KPE Premium, Knox Suite*, or Knox Platform for Customization (KPC) license. \\* For information on Knox Suite, go to: Knox Suite. KPC is a light version of KPE focusing on customization capabilities. These common options are as follows: 1. Profile name - A unique nickname you provide for a set of policy configurations. You can create many different profile names for various sets of configurations. Later, you can use the name for tracking and debugging purposes. We recommend using a name less than 50 characters in length, for example, `MyEnterprise Profile`. 2. KPE Premium License key - This is useful for consoles that do not have Knox Premium License activation built in as a native feature. When this field is used, KSP can activate the license for you when you push the configuration. If your UEM console has already activated a Knox Premium License on your device, there is no need to activate a license using this field. The following image is an example of this field. You only need to input a license if you are using a premium policy. If you do not provide a license key and use a premium policy - or the key provided does not have necessary privileges - the KSP policy fails and produces an error message. 3. Debug modes - When you turn on debug mode, you can view policy results and errors on the device through an app menu. We recommend enabling this mode only during test phases and not during final deployment. If you run into any KSP deployment issues, check this box to enable debug mode and try to perform the action again. You can also export the message and reach out to Knox Support for help to diagnose and fix your issue. 4. DO and PO policies - Depending upon your deployment mode, you need to enable device-wide or Work profile-wide policy controls. Do as follows: Device-wide policies - To enable or disable device-wide policies, use the Enable device policy controls field. Enable this option before using any of the Device-wide policies. If this option is disabled, KSP does not apply any policies in default user (User 0). Work profile-wide policies - To enable or disable Work profile-wide policies, use the Enable work profile policy controls field. Enable this option before using any of the Device-wide policies. If this setting is disabled, KSP does not apply any policy changes inside the Work Profile. #Group policy control flag Every group has a control that enables or disables that policy group. By default every policy group is disabled. You must enable this control before setting any policy in the group. For example, before using any policy in the device-wide policy section, turn on the Enable device-wide policies control first. Further more, to use any device restrictions within the device-wide policy section, turn on Enable device restriction controls and then activate individual policies, such as Allow microphone, Allow Wi-Fi and so on. Control groups are mandatory. Incorrect control group settings or deleting them from input configuration causes KSP to revoke policies or not process policies in that group. The following image illustrates a control group. #Profile Configurations You can save a group of configurations using a Profile Name. Once you save a group of configurations, you can reuse these configurations for as many deployments as you need. For example, in the following image, we have set the DeX profile name as `DeX profile 1`. Any configurations set are saved under the name `DeX profile 1`. When setting policies later, you can reference `DeX profile 1` to quickly set up devices with your saved configurations. Recommended practices , Auto-install - Turn this feature on if your UEM supports it. This feature ensures all devices install KSP automatically when prompted. Auto-update - Turn this feature on if your UEM supports it. This feature ensures that the KSP app is up to date on deployed devices. KSP is designed to be backward compatible. For example, a newer version of the app can handle older schema data, but older app versions can't handle new schema data. Native console policies - Use your UEM console for any policy that is supported natively and use KSP to bridge any gaps. Test in small batches - Always test your KSP schema changes with a limited set of devices, debug the issues (if any) by enabling debug mode, then roll out to wider deployment. Special cases #List applications Some fields allow you to specify more than one app to target. For example: when you select apps to allowlist for a proxy. To list out apps, use a comma-separated list of packages. For example `com.samsung.android.email.provider, com.sec.android.app.sbrowser`. To find a package name, look at the Google Play store URL or contact the app vendor. #Uploading files Some Knox policies, such as DeX customization, require you to provide bulk data, such as an image file. However, OEMConfig specifications do not currently support file upload. If you need to upload a file you can use one of the following two methods: Web URL - Upload the file to a cloud server and provide the web URL as an input string to KSP. Ensure that the URL is publicly accessible. Some UEMs have a limitation on the number of characters you can enter in a string field. In such cases, you cannot use this approach to upload files. Push the image file to the local storage - Use the UEM console to push the image file to the local storage on the device and provide the file path on the device as the input string to KSP. Contact your UEM vendor to find out if they support this feature. Push the image to your device before you install KSP and it attempts to apply any policies to the device.",

            "content": "STIG configurations. This section describes the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) configurations and guidelines that devices need to meet in government and defense agencies. Devices that meet these configurations ensure the maximum protection for sensitive and confidential data as well as improve the security of information systems. As compliance with STIG requires the application of a wide range of configurations, Knox Service Plugin (KSP) attempts to fulfill a set of configurations that the UEM does not support natively. Policies supported by Android Enterprise are not supported by KSP. Overview The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration standards and technical guidance to lock down Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance (IA) enabled devices, information systems, and software that might otherwise become vulnerable to malicious computer attacks. The STIGs are created by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in collaboration with device vendors. Samsung works with DISA to produce a STIG with the specific configuration and technical guidance that defines how organizations can deploy Samsung devices with a required security posture for use within the DoD. #Samsung's STIG For a list of most recently available STIGs, Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDFPPs), and Approved Product List (APL), go to: https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/knox-certifications. The Samsung Android STIGs covers both Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO), and the fully managed device with a work profile use cases. UEMs can deploy these use cases in one of two ways: KPE (AE) - Knox Platform for Enterprise with Android Enterprise, current deployment model , KPE (Legacy) - previous deployment model, which is marked for deprecation DISA recommends that DoD mobile service providers support KPE (AE) deployments to the maximum extent possible. The KPE\"(AE) deployment model complies with DISA's requirements using a UEM that supports AE policies, as well as the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) for additional KPE specific policies necessary for compliance. KSP can configure KPE specific policies for KPE (AE) deployments. KSP does not support KPE (Legacy) based deployments. Please note, UEMs may support KPE specific policies natively, in such case IT Admin may use either UEM or KSP to apply such policies. STIG requirements #Company Owned Business Only (COBO) Fully Managed Devices - also known as Company Owned Business Only (COBO) - are devices owned by the company. Such devices are set up to give IT admins control over an extended range of device settings and additional policy controls. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully\"managed device, go to: STIG compliance for a fully managed device. Before devices are considered STIG-compliant, these devices must meet the following prerequisites: The Samsung Android device must be one of those listed on the APL , The device must be enrolled in the UEM as a fully Managed device , Managed Google Play must be configured , Using managed Google Play, the UEM Administrator must install KSP on the device , A free KPE Premium License must be activated either within the UEM console, or KSP , The UEM administrator must apply the policies listed in the COBO KPE(AE) configuration table , The STIG configuration must match the version of Android OS installed on the device , The COBO KPE(AE) configuration table document contains only one table, \"Table 1: COBO configuration policy rules for Device-Wide Work Environment\" which contains policies that must be applied to the fully managed device , AE policies must be applied using the UEM console , KPE policies must be applied using KSP managed configuration , Appropriate STIG\"policies are applied to the device. For information on applying COBO-specific STIG policies, go to: STIG compliance for COBO devices. #Fully managed device with a work profile Fully managed work profile devices allow work apps and data to be stored in a separate, self-contained space within a device. An employee can continue to use their device as normal; all their personal apps and data remain on the device's primary profile. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully\"managed device with a work profile, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile. Before devices are considered STIG-compliant, these devices must meet the following pre-requisites: The Samsung Android device must be one of those listed on the APL , The device must be enrolled in the UEM as a fully managed device with managed Profile , Managed Google Play must be configured (in the managed Profile) , The UEM Administrator must install two instances of KSP: 1. Using the UEM console, the UEM Administrator must install KSP as a private or internal app within the \"personal\" side of the managed device 2. Using managed Google Play, the UEM Administrator must install KSP within the managed Profile Ensure that the KSP version installed within the Personal profile of the managed device is the same or higher than the KSP version installed within the Managed Work profile. KPE Premium License is activated within the UEM console or using KSP in the managed Work profile. The fully managed device with a work profile KPE (AE) configuration document contains two tables, namely - Table 1: Configuration policy rules for Non-Work environment and Table 2: Configuration policy rules for Work environment. The UEM administrator must apply the policies listed in these two tables as follows: The STIG configuration must match the version of Android OS installed on the device , Apply policies from Table 1: Configuration policy rules for Non-Work Environment to the Personal side of the fully managed device , Apply policies from Table 2: Configuration policy rules for Work Environment the Work profile within the managed device , Apply AE policies using the UEM console. Apply KPE policies using the KSP managed configurations. Appropriate STIG\"policies are applied to the device. For information on applying specific STIG policies, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed device with a work profile. #Using the UEM and KSP to apply STIG policies STIG compliance requires devices to meet strict security requirements. While the actual labels and naming conventions for each of these policies differ for each UEM console, the restrictions that are applicable for each individual policy remain the same irrespective of the UEM used.

For detailed information on configuring STIG policies using your UEM, see your UEM's help documentation. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully managed device, go to: STIG compliance for a fully managed device. To apply STIG compliance policies to COBO devices do as follows: 1. Set up COBO mode on your UEM console. 2. Implement COBO method of AE deployment on your devices. 3. Add KSP as an app in primary profile (DO). 4. Create new DO profiles with appropriate policy restrictions as described in the Configure policies section of the KSP Admin Guide. 5. In your UEM console, navigate to the Device Profiles page. The navigation method and path you need to follow to open the Device Profiles page differs for each UEM. For example, the path for Microsoft Intune is as follows: Devices Profiles & Resources Profiles. Refer to your UEM console's help documentation for detailed information about your UEM's UI. 6. On this page, click Add > Add profile. The select platform to start page opens. 7. On this page, double-click Android. The Add a New Android Profile page opens to show a left navigation menu of items you can configure for your device profile. 8. Using the items on the left navigation menu, edit the STIG compliance policies for COBO devices. See Settings for STIG compliance. Save your changes. 9. Enable audit logging as follows: 1. From the UEM console home page, go to Devices > Device Settings > Android > Intelligent Hub Settings > Samsung Knox settings. 2. Set the value of the Enable Audit Logging field to Enabled. 3.

This section provides high-level instructions to set up and configure STIG policies on a fully managed device with a work profile using VMware Workspace ONE UEM console. For detailed information on configuring STIG policies using VMware Workspace ONE UEM console, see VMware AirWatch v9.x MDM STIG. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile. For information on how to configure VMware Workspace One, see VMware Workspace One and Knox Platform for Enterprise, User Guide VMware Workspace ONE UEM does not currently provide native support for all STIG policies necessary for compliance. IT admins can use KSP from within Workspace ONE to ensure compliance with STIG policies. Currently, you can create a Personal space - also known as Personal profile in Android Enterprise - on fully managed device with a work profile using VMware Workspace ONE UEM, but cannot use KSP to apply additional policies to the Personal space. This results in an inability to use KSP to enforce STIG compliance for Personal space policies. To apply STIG compliance policies: 1. Set the fully managed device with a work profile mode on your UEM console. 2. Implement the fully managed device with a work profile method of AE deployment on your devices. 3. Add KSP as an app in DO and PO. 4. Create new DO and PO profiles with appropriate policy restrictions. 5. In your UEM console, go to Devices > Profiles & Resources > Profiles. The Profiles page opens. 6. On this page, click Add > Add profile. The select platform to start page opens. 7. On this page, double-click Android.

For Android 14 and higher, the CA certificate alias and domain name are now required fields in the configuration, whereas previously they could be left unset. For Knox Service Plugin, this underlying system change affects the Wi-Fi Enterprise Configuration policy, which is a member of a Wi-Fi Configuration. The corresponding fields that are affected are CA Certificate for the CA certificate alias, and Domain Name. If you apply the Wi-Fi Enterprise Configuration policy in your fleet deployment, the Knox Service Plugin team urges you to update your Knox Service Plugin profile or payload. If these fields are unset, the policy will no longer take effect. See the description of Wi-Fi Configuration in the Knox Service Plugin policy schema for all of its component policies and fields. General availability of the Data Roaming Policy November 2nd, 2023 update So as to ensure reliability and avoid unexpected behavior, the Allow data roaming policy was disabled with the Knox Service Plugin 1.4.32 hotfix. Read its release notes for more details. In Knox Service Plugin 23.06, the Data Roaming Policy previously underwent a limited release for certain on-premises solutions. As of 23.09, it's now available for all EMMs and cloud solutions. For the Turn on data roaming policy to take effect, the Allow data roaming policy must be enabled.

            "content": "Debug mode. We understand that successfully deploying your policies and settings correctly is important. To help you test and deploy your configurations, Knox Service Plugin (KSP) includes a setting called Debug mode. Overview By default, KSP runs in the background and does not have a UI. Debug mode enables you to easily see policy results and errors on a device, so you can verify that your configurations are correct. When turned on, it launches an app that displays the status of policies. This app should auto-launch when it receives any new polices. We recommend you use Debug mode with a limited number of devices. You should turn it off for full deployments. Here's what debug mode looks like when opened manually on a device: The app provides a list of the polices that you have pushed, along with details about the last configuration, including: Policy title - Name of the policy. Message - Description of the policy, along with the status of the policy application. Activate Debug mode Debug mode is activated inside your UEM console, in the Knox Service Plugin configuration area. The location and appearance of the Debug mode feature in your UEM console may vary depending upon your UEM UI. Here is an example of how it may look: Once you activate debug mode within your UEM, the next time policy changes are pushed to a device, the KSP app opens on the device. For example, if you are trying to debug the Enable fingerprint authentication feature, follow these steps in your UEM: 1. Turn on the Debug mode flag. 2. Expand Device-wide policies, and set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Password Policy > Biometric authentication, configure the Enable fingerprint authentication policy. 4. Push the policies to a device. 5. Check the KSP app for debug information. If, for any reason, the app does not launch: Confirm that the device is using the latest Google Play services and Play client application. Confirm that the UEM has pushed the appropriate policies to the device. Some UEMs have a delay between the time a policy is saved on the console and when it is received by the device. You may have to open the UEM agent on the device and perform a manual refresh to receive the policy. Refer to your UEM's instructions for more information. Debug mode features You can perform the following actions when Debug mode is activated: To apply any updated policies, tap Apply Latest Policies. If the policy updates aren't applied when you tap Apply Latest Policies, try again in a few minutes. It can take a short time for updated policies to be pushed from your UEM to devices. When you first open the app, it only shows the most recent pushed configuration. Tap this configuration to display the list of configuration results. You can tap Configuration results and then tap Policies received to see the policies in JSON format. To get a log of the current configurations, tap ![](./../assets/details-3-dots.png) (Details) > Export results. Successful policies are displayed in black text. Failed policies are displayed in red text. Contact Support and provide debug files In some cases, you may want to contact Support for help with a KSP issue. If you do, you need to provide the following files for investigation: ConfigurationResults_\\.txt, ReceivedPolicies_\\.txt, dumpstate log file To obtain these files for upload: 1. After enabling debug mode as described in the previous sections, open the KSP app. 2. Tap the latest configuration. 3. Tap ![](../assets/details-3-dots.png) (Details) > Export results. 4. Tap Save to save the KSP configuration results file to your Internal storage > Download folder. 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, this time tapping Export policies received, to export and save the KSP received policies file. 6. See Dumpstate logs (phone) for instructions on saving your device's dumpstate log file. Skip steps 2 - 5 in that procedure. Save the dumpstate log file soon after your issue occurs. If too much time passes, the relevant activity might no longer be contained in the log file. 7. Upload these three files to your support ticket.",

The most frequently asked questions about Knox Service Plugin As a general guideline, we recommend that you use the built-in features that your UEM console provides, and use Knox Service Plugin only for applying additional policies that are available only through Knox Service Plugin and KPE. For example, lets say you want to disable Bluetooth on a device. If your UEM console already supports disabling Bluetooth, then don't use Knox Service Plugin to disable Bluetooth. If the UEM Console supports all the Knox device restrictions you want to apply on the device, then set up the policy with the UEM console and don't use the \"device restrictions\" section of the Knox Service Plugin managed configuration. That is, keep \"Enable device restriction controls\" disabled. However, if you need to use even a single device restriction in Knox Service Plugin, then you should turn on \"Enable device restriction controls\" and then set up all the device restriction controls within that structure.",

Settings Problem Resolution Dual DAR Dual DAR is not working on my devices. You must meet the following requirements to use Dual DAR. Devices should support Dual DAR 1.1 version or higher (check by going to Device Settings &gt; About phone &gt; Software information &gt; Knox version) , Only works for fully managed device with a work profile deployments for the encryption of Work Profiles within the managed devices , You must use Knox Mobile Enrollment(KME) 1.23 or higher version to enroll the devices. See the following release notes for more information setting up Dual DAR with KME. NOTE: KSP does not initiate Dual DAR, it only helps activate a KPE Premium Dual DAR license. You configure the parameters after it is setup during enrollment by KME. Devices set up with File Based Encryption (FBE) KSP does not receive policies pushed to devices that are set up with File-based encryption (FBE) This can occur only if a device is rebooted and has not yet been unlocked. The user must unlock the mobile device with their chosen authentication in order to decrypt it. Once this is done, the KSP policies are pushed to the device. Device restrictions or advanced restrictions Native UEM policies should take precedence over KSP policies. If your UEM console natively supports a policy. You should use it instead of the KSP equivalent. This can help avoid unpredictable behavior on the device. If a KSP policy is used, the value may be overridden by your UEM in future deployment, depending on how you have set up your deployment schedule. Example: if your UEM console supports disable NFC and KSP also supports disable NFC, use the native UEM console policy. Multifactor authentication (2FA) and biometrics A conflict between multifactor authentication (2FA) and Biometric policies can cause a device to become \"Admin locked.\" When this occurs, the user can't unlock the device without admin assistance. This can occur if you turn off biometric unlock before you turn off 2FA. To avoid Admin Lock: When you activate 2FA on a device, turn on your biometric policy first (iris or fingerprint). While 2FA is enabled and running on a device, do not independently disable your biometric policy (iris or fingerprint). When you are turning off 2FA, make sure you follow this order of logic. Disable 2FA Disable biometric unlock We also strongly recommend you disable One Lock on devices where 2FA is used for Work Profile authentication. One Lock policies are supported by your native UEM console and outside the scope of KSP. NOTE: 2FA only works with Iris and Fingerprint (FP) only. Face recognition is independent and is not linked to 2FA. DeX Customization features not working DeX Customization error messages are not showing up in debug mode. Many DeX Customization features do not return errors (regardless of debug mode or normal operation). If your device has correct OS and DeX version then these will be applied, if not they will be ignored. To see the debug messages, use a device with a version of Knox that supports the DeX features you are using. Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan) Certificate based authentication with a Device Owner (DO) does not work with Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan). No resolution. Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan) does not support certificate based authentication when deployed to a DO device. Dual SIM KSP is currently able to restrict operations on the second SIM but is unable to hide the second SIM's UI on the device. No resolution. The current implementation does not block the UI, however, it restricts calls, SMS, MMS, and data connections using internal radio layer APIs on the second SIM's internal.",

            "content": "Device orphaned from EMM after failed factory reset. When a device is managed by an EMM and Knox Service Plugin, the admin can configure the Allow Factory Reset Knox Service Plugin policy to prevent the device from being wiped accidentally. However, if the policy is set to Disable and the admin issues a wipe or delete command to the device, rather than wiping the device, the EMM inadvertently unenrolls the device and its policies remain. The device then enters an orphaned state where it remains restricted, and neither the admin nor the device user is unable to remove those restrictions. Cause Before delivering a wipe or delete command to a device, not all EMMs check the Knox Service Plugin configuration. As a result, the device can't be factory reset due to the Knox Service Plugin configuration, and is removed from the EMM console. Devices enrolled in Knox Manage don't encounter this issue, as Knox Manage checks the Knox Service Plugin configuration before proceeding with a reset. Workaround Before you wipe a device through your EMM, ensure that the Allow Factory Reset policy is set to Enable. To change this policy: 1. On the EMM console, go to the Knox Service Plugin configuration. 2. Modify the following policy: Device-wide policies > Device Restrictions > Allow Factory Reset - Enable. 3. Save and apply your changes to the affected devices. If this issue has occurred and the devices are restricted, contact your regional Samsung's customer service center.",
