            "content": "Configure dashboard settings. After your devices get added to the Knox Asset Intelligence console and enrolled in the service, you can begin using the Dashboard to view business insights related to your fleet's app, battery, and network usage without any additional setup. However, if you want to customize your Dashboard layout, define thresholds in order to receive alerts, or configure work shifts, then you'll need to configure your Dashboard Settings. To do this, click Settings near the top-right corner of the Dashboard. The Dashboard settings page is divided into the following tabs: Data conditions, Customize, Thresholds, Network, Managed apps Depending on your admin permissions, you may not be able to modify certain dashboard settings. Please ensure your admin account has the proper permissions. Data Conditions The DATA CONDITIONS tab allows you to define when and how data gets collected, and what type of data gets collected by the Knox Asset Intelligence service. #Work shift data collection By default, Knox Asset Intelligence collects data at all times (if data is available). However, if you want to only collect data at certain times or under certain conditions, then you can enable the Work shift configuration option. Once enabled, data will only be collected under one of these conditions: 1. During a specific time window on certain days. 2. When devices connect to an allowed Wi-Fi access point. 3. When managed app activity is detected. For example, if you only want to collect work-related data from 9-5 PM on weekdays, you can set Work shift configuration to do so accordingly. By default, the work shift setting is turned off, and the devices collect data throughout the day. A shift end is detected when a device hasn't reported activity from a managed app or connected to an allowlisted access point for longer than two hours. You can manage the Wi-Fi SSID allowlist and managed app list by clicking the corresponding links, and specify individual managed apps that will trigger a work shift. #Data upload The Data upload section lets you specify what type of data gets collected, and (for some insights) how often data gets collected. ##Network You can collect data related to your device's ability to connect to Wi-Fi or mobile networks. Whenever an abnormal Wi-Fi disconnection event occurs, a system-level Samsung module reports it to the Knox Asset Intelligence agent on your device. Events are broadcast to the server every time they occur. For mobile data, carrier connectivity information is recorded along with data usage statistics. Mobile data is collected every 2 hours by the agent, and is uploaded to the server daily. You can upload a list of SSIDs to the console and use them to filter device data. For example, you might want to view scanning data from devices connected to a specific Wi-Fi access point. Three network data collection options are available: Wi-Fi disconnection/connection data for allowlisted SSIDs - Enable this feature to collect Wi-Fi disconnection events that occur on allowlisted SSIDs. Mobile/wifi data usage - Enable this feature to track all mobile network data usage on your devices, during and outside of work shifts. Network latency results for specified test servers - Enable this feature to collect all network latency results during work shifts for test servers you define. Refer to Network usage, Wi-Fi disconnection events, and Network latency for more details. ##App Your devices can collect information about app-related activity, such as run time, Wi-Fi and mobile data usage, and issues that occur. You can choose to collect data for the following options: Run time - Track foreground and background run time, as well as battery usage on your devices. This data is only tracked when the device is using the battery, and not when the device is being charged. Network usage - Collect Wi-Fi and mobile usage data on your devices. Issues - Track app usage, app no response, force close, and abnormal app events. You can select a value from 1 - 24 hours for your devices to report app issue data to the Knox Asset Intelligence server. Selecting a shorter time period consumes more battery on the device, but you can track event analytics closer to real-time. Refer to App usage and App issues for more details. ##Battery The Battery section allows you to collect information about certain battery-related events that your devices can report. Battery data is reported when a battery event occurs, or when battery-related information is updated on the device. Refer to General battery charts, Battery status, and Battery state of health for more information. When enabling battery-related data collection, you also have the option to enable collection of Charge issues event data. This collection of Charge issues is currently in a Labs state, meaning when you enable this option, Knox Asset Intelligence collects data related to battery charging issues such as water protection failures, incomplete connections and more. This data will be used to provide battery charging insights in future releases. ##Device drop detection Knox Asset Intelligence can identify when a device is dropped and log an event when it occurs. This feature is supported by a limited number of devices. Please see Devices supporting drop detection for more details. This feature is currently under development in our Labs. Note that there are limitations on reported events and should be used as a reference only. Measured values may differ from actual. #System Knox Asset Intelligence can monitor your device's storage usage status. If devices have used 90% or more of their total storage, you'll see a Bad status in the Dashboard. If they have used less than 90%, you'll see a Normal status. ##Scanning Statistics If your organization also uses Knox Capture, configure the scanning insights that Knox Asset Intelligence receives here. You can choose to refresh scanning data after every scan event or after a preset amount of time (1-24 hours). Refer to Scanning performance for more details. Customize If you prefer to focus on certain data insights, you can define which tiles appear on your dashboard. Select or clear one or more insights and save your changes to remove the corresponding tiles from your dashboard without impacting reported data. To enable Battery level at shift start and Battery level at shift end, you must first define the conditions for a work shift on the DATA CONDITIONS tab. Thresholds On the THRESHOLDS tab, you can set certain event thresholds at which alerts are triggered. #Today's issues Drag the sliders to adjust the yellow and red thresholds, which represent the percentage of impacted devices required before an alert is sent. Take, for example, a case where you're managing a group of 100 devices. The yellow alert threshold for Abnormal app events is set to 15% and the red threshold is set to 25%. You would receive an email alert when 16 devices report an abnormal app event, and another when 26 devices report an event. TODAY'S ISSUES also supports device groups. Admins can set a minimum number of devices for a group to trigger an email alert. Doing so ensures you only receive relevant alerts for the devices you're managing. Under the sliders, enter a minimum number of devices for a group. Any device groups below the specified minimum size are ignored in threshold event calculations. Knox Asset Intelligence also allows you to manage the types of report data you receive. There are two ways to manage your report preferences: Through the Reporting menu in Manage services & preferences, By clicking EMAIL PREFERENCES in the bottom-right corner of TODAY'S ISSUES Choosing either option takes you to a menu where you can select whether to receive reports for app-related issues, Wi-Fi-related issues, battery-related issues, or all of them. If you've configured a list of managed apps, only managed app issues are reported by default. #Network You may want to track whether a certain number of Wi-Fi disconnection events are occurring, based on the following conditions: BSSIDs (basic service set identifiers) with a certain number of disconnection events, per day, Devices with a certain number of disconnection events, per day, Groups that contain devices with a certain number of disconnection events, per day Under NETWORK, you can enter a number of events as a threshold for each category. This number must exceed 1. Once the detected number of disconnection events exceeds the threshold, an email alert is triggered. In the top-right corner of the NETWORK section, enable Recommended Wi-Fi disconnection thresholds to have the service intelligently define Wi-Fi disconnection event thresholds based on an internal statistical model. This option is only available once Knox Asset Intelligence has collected enough network data from your devices. If you enable the recommended values and save your changes, the existing threshold values are overridden for all admins in your tenant. #App To identify apps that are consuming abnormally large amounts of battery or network data, you can set threshold percentages for both battery consumption and network usage. These thresholds are measured per day and per device. If an app exceeds one of the thresholds, the device records it as an event and the data is displayed as an insight in the relevant dashboard charts. If a small number of your devices are reporting high app usage statistics that aren't representative of the whole device fleet, you can also enter a minimum device count to ignore app data from those devices. In the top-right corner of the APP section, enable Recommended app thresholds to have the service intelligently define app battery and network consumption event thresholds based on an internal statistical model. If you've added Managed Applications in Settings > MANAGED APPS, you'll see a checkbox indicating that only managed apps are used by default when calculating recommended app battery and network consumption. To calculate recommended thresholds based on all apps in your organization, clear the checkbox. #Battery In this category, you can define the percentage of battery consumption that constitutes a battery drain event, as well as the battery percentage considered to be a low battery level. You can also configure when battery alerts appear on your dashboard charts. Specify the threshold percentages of devices in your fleet or groups to exceed before an alert is triggered. For low battery events, battery drain events, and charge events, you can also select the average number of events in a day that must be reached before the alert triggers. In the top-right corner of the BATTERY section, enable Recommended battery thresholds to have the service intelligently define battery event thresholds based on an internal statistical model. This option is only available once Knox Asset Intelligence has collected enough battery data from your devices. If you enable the recommended values and save your changes, the existing threshold values are overridden for all admins in your tenant. Network The NETWORK tab lets you manage your SSID allowlist and latency test servers. #SSID allowlist Select whether you want to capture data for all SSIDs or only for certain SSIDs. If you choose to capture data only for allowlisted SSIDs, enter an SSID in the provided field. Click ADD SSID to add more, up to a maximum of 10. When you're finished, click SAVE. Make sure your SSID names don't contain spaces, otherwise you may experience data collection issues. Your Wi-Fi connectivity events are then captured based on the option you selected. #Manage latency test servers To help you passively monitor network speeds, Knox Asset Intelligence offers the ability to add up to five latency test servers. These servers also help troubleshoot whether latency issues might be caused by client, server, or intermediate network infrastructure problems. For each test server, you can select one of the three types of latency tests: PING - Enter either an IP address or a domain name. For example, 0.0.0.0 or _website.com_. DNS - Enter a domain name. For example, _website.com_. TCP - Enter a URL that leads to a content page. For example, _http\\://www.website.com/content_. Every two hours during a work shift, Knox Asset Intelligence performs a latency test on each of the servers you set up. If you want to see how long it takes a specific app to reach a server, you can add an optional Related app to your test. For example, if you add the Google app to your test, the Network latency response times tile displays the name of the related app when you hover your cursor over the response time value for the server. Managed apps In the MANAGED APPS tab in Dashboard settings, you can categorize apps as unmanaged or managed, letting you easily filter out unwanted insights on the dashboard. By default, all apps are considered unmanaged. Only apps used within the last 60 days are available for categorization. Use the search bar to search for an app or package name, or select apps in either list to move. You can move apps back and forth between the two lists using the arrow buttons in the middle. If you only want to see data from managed apps on the console, select Show only my managed apps in the dashboard and in the app detailed pages. If you wish to calculate recommended battery or network consumption threshold values using only your managed apps, simply add one or more apps to the Managed Apps list. The Use only managed apps to calculate the recommended threshold value for battery and network consumption checkbox will be selected once you add a managed app. If you wish to use ALL apps to calculate recommended thresholds for battery and network consumption (instead of just managed apps), you can clear the checkbox.",

Scanning Scanning performance See scanning insights from your devices enrolled in Knox Capture, including total scan counts and average scans per device. Your devices must be enrolled in both Knox Capture and Knox Asset Intelligence to see these insights. System Storage usage status Lets you see how many devices are close to reaching their maximum storage capacity, letting you proactively plan for data backups or offloading of unnecessary data. Data refresh rates While the Knox Asset Intelligence agent runs on a device, it continually collects device usage data and sends this information to the servers in order to be turned into actionable business insights on your Dashboard. Depending on the insight, there can be a delay between when data gets collected on the device, and when it actually shows up on your dashboard. Some dashboard tiles are denoted with a Today indicator, indicating that data is only available for the current day, regardless of the reporting period selected. Near the top of each dashboard, you can select the date and time range for which you want to see data. The date and time range selection is global, which means it affects all other tiles - except those denoted as Today - across all dashboards in the console. The following table details the update rate for each data insight on the dashboard: Real-time means that data is sent to the server at the time the event occurred, and you can see it on the Dashboard immediately. Previous day means that data is sent to the server on the day the event occurred, but you cannot see data on the Dashboard until the day after. Data type Data insight Dashboard update rate Available date ranges Common Device status Real-time Can only view data for Today Battery Battery status and state of health Real-time Can only view data for Today Low battery, Battery drain, and Charge events Previous day Can view data for Yesterday, or Last 7, 14, 30, or 60 days.

Dashboard tiles explained Whether you're viewing the main Knox Asset Intelligence Dashboard, or one of the sub-dashboards for Network, App, or Battery insights, each tile generally consist of the following components: 1. The main data set displaying a table or chart of the insight's top issues or events. 2. An option to view expanded data insights or settings. 3. A notification section that lets you know when data thresholds are reached, as well as other important information related to your insight. See Dashboard settings: Thresholds for more information. 4. A date and time stamp for the last update, and a manual refresh button to request new data. See Data refresh rates to learn more. Some dashboard tiles - like Device statuses and App type - do not provide expanded or drill-down views of the data. #Main tile view Most dashboard tiles display their key data insights in the form of charts, tables, or lists. Some tiles like the Apps with most issues provide both a chart and a list to provide greater detail into the insight. Just below the main data set, you might see alerts, notifications, or other important information related to your insight. Some dashboard insights display notifications when critical event thresholds are reached (for example, when apps use more than 100MB of mobile data per day), while others display the top issue, app, or group contributing to the insight (for example, which is the most used app across your entire fleet). Near the bottom-right corner of each tile, you'll see the last date and time data got refreshed. Some tiles like Today's issues allow you to refresh data on demand. If a tile has a Refresh icon next to the timestamp, you can click the icon to request the latest data from the server. #Expanded view To help you analyze critical issues in greater detail, most Dashboard tiles provide an _expanded_ view of the data set. To see an insight's expanded view, click the > button near to top-right corner of the tile. Depending on the insight, some expanded views include a chart of the most critical issues near the top of the page, and a table detailing all issues near the bottom. Others might just display information in a table (without a chart). For example, the expanded view for Apps with highest battery consumption shows the top 5 worst performing apps, and their consumed battery power percentage over the selected reporting period. While the chart only displays the top 5 worst apps, the table below displays every app that has consumed excessive battery over the same reporting period. Most insights allow you to filter the data set and download a CSV file of the data from the expanded view. If the option is available, click the Filter icon to open the filter panel and select specific parameters, then click Apply to save your changes. The page updates and shows only the filtered results, and filter tags appear above the data. To remove the filters and restore the default settings, click CLEAR ALL FILTERS. If available, you can click the CUSTOMIZE TABLE button ( ... ) to show or hide columns in your table. Note that some columns are mandatory and cannot be hidden, and some insights only allow you to display up to 7 columns at a time. And if the CSV option is available, you can click DOWNLOAD AS CSV to export the table in CSV format. The columns in the CSV file will match the columns in the table. #Drill-down view For some insights, you can get an even deeper analysis of the data by clicking certain key-values in the expanded-view table. This will open a _drill-down_ view for those values, providing additional details not found in the insight's expanded view. For example, in the expanded view table for Apps with highest battery consumption, the key-values are the applications in the APP column. Clicking any link in the APP column takes you to a drill-down view for that application, letting you see extended details like which _versions_ of the app consume the most battery power, and how many _devices_ are running each version. Like with the expanded view, you can also use the filter (if available) to focus on specific data, customize your table, or download the table as a CSV file for offline viewing.",

            "content": "App issues. How it works #App no response and force close events On Samsung devices, a hardware quality manager service runs at the system level. This service captures any fatal errors on running apps in real time, which are retrieved periodically by the Knox Asset Intelligence agent. These error events are reported as app no response (ANR) and force close (FC) data. Use ANR and FC data to identify whether app events are isolated incidents, or if there's an overall stability issue with a business app. You can also use the cascading reports to quickly pinpoint the root cause of an error and resolve it. Captured error data includes: App information - The app package name and version. Timestamp - The time the error occurred in the device's time zone. Class name - The Android system-defined reason for the error. To address user privacy concerns on personally-owned devices, Knox Asset Intelligence only monitors apps installed in the work profile. If an app is installed in both the work and personal profiles, then data from both profiles is reported. Any recorded ANR and FC events are uploaded to the Knox Asset Intelligence server at a time interval you can configure in the Dashboard settings. By default, this interval is once per hour. ANR and FC data is updated on your dashboard hourly unless you extend the time interval. #Abnormal app events Samsung devices can automatically detect and log a set of pre-defined abnormal app event types caused by native and third-party apps that cause excessive battery drain. The Knox Asset Intelligence agent reports these events to the server in real-time, allowing you to quickly identify and troubleshoot problematic apps. Only apps installed in the work profile are monitored for these events. The pre-defined abnormal app events on Samsung devices are: Frequent device wake, High background battery usage, Excessive background battery usage, Background CPU usage, Excessive background camera usage Abnormal app events are updated on your dashboard hourly unless you extend the time interval. For more information, refer to Data refresh cycles. Dashboard tile views For a description of the dashboard tiles, refer to Dashboard tiles explained. #Main tile view The Apps with most issues events chart helps you identify and visualize which apps are at the highest risk of disrupting business operations. This chart shows the top 5 apps on your devices that triggered the app not responding, force close, or abnormal events. The information at the bottom of the chart identifies the top app and determines which app version and OS version are associated with the highest number of issue events. If your devices are associated with groups, a Groups with app issue events chart lists the five groups with the highest number of reported app issues, the number of impacted apps associated with those issues, and the number of unique impacted devices. If you're globally filtering the Knox Asset Intelligence console by a certain group, that group is shown in the chart even if it isn't one of the five groups with the highest number of reported app issues. In either chart, click an app name, a group name, or the Expand icon to go to the corresponding expanded view. If you select a group name, the expanded view is filtered by events belonging to only that group. #Expanded view In the chart, the event types are further broken down by time period. By default, each bar in the chart represents the total event occurrences in one day. Hover over a bar segment to see how many times a type of event happened that day. Below the chart, the detailed list separates the data by the following categories: APP - The name of the app. Click the name to go to a drill-down view of events associated with the app. PACKAGE NAME - The package name of the app. For longer package names, hover over it to see the full name. DEVICE COUNT - The number of devices that reported issue events. TOTAL ISSUE EVENTS - The total number of app not responding, force close, and abnormal events. ANR EVENTS - The number of app not responding events that occurred. See App no response and force close events for more details. FORCE CLOSE EVENTS - The number of force close events that occurred.

To better understand how your devices are used on the frontline, you can monitor which apps workers are using, how long they're being used for, and how much battery power and mobile data (Wi-Fi and cellular) are being consumed. Use the cascading charts to view aggregated data among all apps, or narrow it down to a single app. Only work profile app usage is tracked on personally-enabled devices. Module views For a description of dashboard tiles, refer to Dashboard tiles explained. #Dashboard tile The Total app usage, Foreground app usage, and Background app usage tiles show the combined running times for the 5 most commonly used apps on your devices. You can also hover over a bar in the tile to see metrics for a specific app. At the bottom of this view, the most commonly-used app is highlighted, along with its average run time across the devices that have it installed. App usage data isn't collected when the device is charging. To further enhance app insights, Knox Asset Intelligence breaks down apps into two categories - managed and unmanaged. Managed apps are apps that are related to business operations, while unmanaged apps are related to all other activities. Using this feature, you can easily filter out app activities that aren't work-related. In this tile, you can see the number of managed and unmanaged apps as both a visualization and list. At the bottom of the tile, the percentage of managed apps as part of the total number of apps is highlighted. Additionally, the Apps with highest battery consumption and Apps with highest network usage tiles provide you with details on which apps are consuming the most battery and network data. Apps with highest battery consumption - Shows the top five apps that consume the most battery on average, per device and per day. Apps with highest network usage - Shows the top 5 apps with the highest network usage, in MB. Usage is separated into Wi-Fi and mobile categories in the graph, with the average usage amount per app listed underneath. By default, if an app reports high battery or network consumption data on 10 or fewer devices, the app is excluded from the reporting data. For example, if only 5 devices in your fleet are using the YouTube app, this app will not be included in the reported data, even if it consumes the highest battery or network resources in your fleet. To record highest battery and network consumption data for all apps, regardless of how many devices are running them, go to Settings > THRESHOLDS > APP, then change the value to 0 in the Exclude apps that report battery consumption and network usage data for N devices or less field. Click the Settings (gear) icon to go to the dashboard settings and configure a list of managed apps. Only apps that Knox Asset Intelligence has collected data on within the last 60 days can be seen in the list.

To access Location settings, open the Location dashboard, click the menu button (three vertical dots) near the top left corner of the page, then click Settings. By default, location tracking is set to OFF to protect user privacy. If this setting is disabled, Knox Asset Intelligence won't request location permissions from device users after enrollment. If you enable indoor or outdoor location tracking in the console, the device user still needs to enable Google runtime permission for location on their device before location data can be collected. The Knox Asset Intelligence agent disables location tracking on the device by default. You can send a notification to access the device's location permissions by going to the Devices page, then selecting one or more devices and clicking ACTIONS > Send permissions notification. Once the device user receives the notification and enables location permissions, you can start collecting location data. All location-enabled devices periodically send their location data to the Knox Asset Intelligence server at fixed intervals: For Outdoor location tracking, data is sent in hour and minute intervals. Enter a value between 0-24 hours and 0-59 minutes. Default value is 5 minutes. Minimum value is 1 minute. For Indoor location tracking, data is sent in minute and second intervals. It is recommended that you enter a minimum value of 15 seconds, as a shorter time period consumes more battery power on the device. Default and minimum value is 15 seconds. In order to use indoor location tracking features, the Indoors option must be enabled AND at least one Venue must be created. See Create venues to learn more.

The Assets page is divided into two tabs: DEVICES and IMMOVABLE ASSETS. Devices - Your mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). See the Location Overview page for a full list of devices that support outdoor and indoor location tracking features. Immovable assets - Wi-Fi access points (APs) and similar devices that provide indoor location tracking capabilities. Sets - Your location-tracking devices organized into logical collections. Upload assets The Devices on the Assets page are uploaded through the normal device upload process documented on the Manage devices page. For Immovable assets, since they are used purely for indoor location tracking purposes, you upload these assets when you create an indoor location tracking Venue. See Create venues to learn more. Sets Sets are logical collections of devices that help make map filtering and indoor location tracking analytics easier. Sets exist only within the Dashboard's Location module, and function similarly to device-groups, but with the following differences: 1. Sets can be created on the console, whereas groups can only be created by uploading a CSV file or through an EMM. 2. The same device can exist in more than one set, whereas a device can only exist in one group. A default set (S.0) containing all devices is automatically created for all customers using the indoor-location tracking feature. You can created additional Sets based on your requirements. To create a set: 1. On the Assets page, click the SETS tab, then click NEW SET. The Add devices to new set page opens. 2. Select one or more devices from the list, then click ADD. You can also use the search bar to find devices before adding. 3. In the Create new set dialogue, give your set a name and optional description, then click ADD. The name can only contain alphabet, number, dash, or period characters, and cannot be more than 18 characters in length. 4. Navigate back to the SETS tab to view a list of all sets in your fleet. To edit your set information: 1. Click a SET ID from the list. A side-panel displays your set information. 2. Click Edit to change your set name, use to toggle to make the set Active or Inactive, or click DELETE SET to remove it entirely. To add devices to a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Add devices to set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click ADD. To remove devices from a set: 1. Select a set from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Remove devices from set. 2. In the Add devices page, select the devices from the list, then click REMOVE.

To download your sets information as a CSV file, select the one or more sets from the list, then click the ACTIONS > Download CSV. View asset information Viewing asset information from the Location dashboard is similar to viewing device information from the Devices page. Simply select either the DEVICES or IMMOVABLE ASSETS tab, then in the list of assets, click an ASSET ID to open a sliding panel with details about the asset. If you have many assets in your list, you can quickly find an asset by entering its IMEI or serial number in the search field. Find an asset The Assets page provides several tools to help find devices in the real world easier. With these tools, you can force the device to play a sound, vibrate, or turn on its flashlight for a set duration, and send notifications to device users with instructions to contact the company in the event the device is found. The Find asset tools only work for mobile devices, and not immovable objects. To find an asset: 1. On the Assets page, use the checkboxes to select one or more devices, then click ACTIONS > Find asset. 2. In the Sound field, set the alert volume level by moving the slider. 3. In the Vibrate field, toggle whether you want to force the device to vibrate (Default: Off ). 4. In the Flash light field, toggle whether you want to turn on the camera's flashlight (Default: Off ). 5. In Battery saving mode, toggle on if you want to place the device in battery saving mode when an alert is sent (Default: Off ). 6. In Set time period for the triggers, select the duration that you want to trigger the alert for: Until the device is found - activates the alert until the device user responds to it. Set duration (Default: 30 minutes) - Determines the amount of time that the alert is active. 7. In SUPPORT CONTACT DETAILS, enter the name of your organization and a contact phone number. The users will see a notification asking them to call this number if the device is found. 8. Click FIND NOW to send the alert and notification to the selected devices. # Find asset user screen After you click FIND NOW, the user sees a full screen notification on the device asking them to swipe to turn off the alarm. Doing so lets you know that the asset isn't lost, and is still in use. In case the user misses the alert, a message appears in the notification panel that instructs them to contact you about their device. If the device is lost and you've filled in your organization's contact info, a button appears underneath the alarm with a contact number. The user can tap the button to call the number on the screen. #Get the latest location If you want to get the last known location for a device without having to wait for its next update interval, you can use the Get the latest location feature. To do this: 1. On the Assets page, use the checkboxes to select one or more devices, then click ACTIONS > Get the latest location. 2. The Assets page will update and you will see: Update pending in the STATUS column for your queried device(s) if they are not active.

            "content": "Create venues (Labs). In Knox Asset Intelligence, Venues are a way of identifying geographical areas for the purpose of indoor location tracking. A Venue can be a single building, or it can be a property with multiple buildings within its boundaries. In order to view indoor location tracking statuses on the Location dashboard, or view indoor location related analytics, you must first create one or more Venues. There are two options to create Venues: A Lite mode option - easy to create but less accurate using floor plan image. A Full mode option - more time-consuming to create but highly accurate. How to create a Venue The process for creating either venue type is similar. To create a Venue: 1. From the left navigation pane, click Venues (Labs) under the Location menu. 2. Click CREATE VENUE. 3. Select whether you want to create a Lite mode or Full mode venue, then click CHOOSE THIS METHOD. To create a Full mode Venue, you MUST already have an IMDF file prepared. 4. On the Create venue page, enter a name and address for the venue. You'll see the location displayed on the map. 5. Under Buildings, click ADD BUILDING, then add a name and address for the building. This can be the same as your venue name and address if your venue only has a single building. 6. Repeat this step if you have multiple buildings. #Prepare floor plans and immovable objects Once you've selected the type of venue you want to create, you'll need to prepare your floor plans and map the locations of your immovable assets. Before you upload your floor plan: 1. Make sure your floor plan images are at least 300 DPI, and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format for Lite venue types, and IMDF for Full venue types. 2. Mark your floor plan with directional arrows as indicated in the following diagram. 3. Using the provided CSV template, enter the following information for each immovable asset you want to include in your floor plan: Group name - The type of immovable asset. This release only supports Wi-Fi AP-802.11mc as the Group name. Asset ID - The unique identifier for the asset (IMEI). BSSID - The basic service set identifier used to identify an access point. Friendly name - A custom (user-friendly) name given to the asset, which can be used to differentiate it from similar assets. For example, \"Conference room 1\" , Usage - Depending on whether the asset is intended to be used indoors or outdoors, either Indoor Only or Outdoor Only respectively. This will affect the internal accuracy calculation algorithms and how the Access Point location information is sent to the location tracking algorithm. Coordinate type - Either Geo or Relative. If you use relative coordinates, the bottom-left corner is marked (0,0). Height - The height of the property, in the unit of measurement designated by the Scale factor , Position coordinates - The location of your immovable assets. If the coordinate type is Geo, latitude and longitude values. For example, enter -123.456789; -98.123456. If the coordinate type is Relative, coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the floor plan and in the unit of measurement designated by Scale factor. For example, if the scale factor is meters and the immovable asset is 100 m above (0,0) and 200 m to the right of (0,0), enter 100;200 as the position coordinates. Scale factor - The unit of measurement for the height and relative coordinates. For example, meters or feet. #Upload floor plans and immovable assets Now that your floor plan and immovable asset CSV file is complete, you can upload the information to the server and build your venue. To do this: 1. Back on the CREATE VENUE page, next to Buildings, click ADD FLOOR PLANS & IMMOVABLE ASSETS. 2. To the left of your building name, click > to expand the floor details. 3. Next to Total building floors, enter the number of floors in your building.= 4. Click ADD FLOOR to enter details for your first floor. Select a floor number, enter a friendly name for it, and upload the following files: Floor plan , CSV file with immovable asset information , (For Lite mode only) A CSV file of the venue's dimensions 5. Repeat for any additional building floors. If you have multiple floors, you can select one of them as the default floor. 6. For additional buildings, repeat these same steps to upload their floor plans and immovable assets. 7. At the bottom of the page, click GO BACK to return to the venue creation page. 8. If your floor plans meet the requirements - that is, at least 300 DPI and in PNG, JPG, or SVG format - and your immovable asset CSV files contain the proper fields, a message under each building name shows Floor plans and immovable assets uploaded. Assign devices to buildings Before you assign your devices, make sure they're grouped in Knox Asset Intelligence first. 1. At the bottom of the CREATE VENUE page, click ADD MOVABLE ASSETS. 2. Beside a building name, click > to expand the details. 3. Under Groups, enter the name of the Knox Asset Intelligence device group you want to add. You can select one or more groups to add. 4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for any additional buildings in your venue. 5. Click REQUEST TO PROCESS. #Verify venue Your venue information is then submitted to a Samsung admin for processing, and you'll receive an email once processing is complete. After a Samsung admin processes your venue information, you then need to verify whether the buildings, floor plans, and immovable assets are correct. 1. On the Venues page, select a venue with the Pending verification status. 2. Click ACTIONS, then Verify venue. 3. On the VERIFY VENUE page, your floor plan is shown with boundaries and immovable assets added. Check whether the immovable asset locations and floor plan placement are correct. If all three are correct, select Yes for all, then click VERIFY & PUBLISH. If not, select No for the items that aren't correct, then click RETURN. You're prompted to provide a description of the inaccuracy for each applicable category. Then, click RETURN AND REQUEST TO PROCESS. If you verified the immovable asset locations and floor plan placement as correct, the venue status changes to Published and you can then start seeing indoor location data for your venue. Otherwise, your venue is sent back to the Samsung admin to be processed again.",

Hover over a point in the chart to see the name of the venue, the date, and the asset count. Analytics for a specific venue #Venue map After you create your first venue, the Venue map section displays a geographical map or floor plan with the last known location of devices marked on it. Above the map, the total number of devices and the total number of zones are shown. You can also search for a specific device by its IMEI, which shows its corresponding location on the venue map. #Asset travel history by zone This chart is only available when you search for a device under Venue map. To help you easily visualize how an asset is moving around the venue, a chart is shown that maps your asset's movement between zones, including how long it stays in each zone and how many times it visits a zone during the set time period. You can use this information to determine how you can optimize a specific worker or department's workflow - for example, you might find that device traffic is high between zones that are further apart. To increase productivity, you could consider moving those zones, or tasks done in those zones, closer together. If you delete a zone, historical location data collected for that zone might still be shown in this chart. #Floor traffic heatmap For an overall view of which areas in your venue encounter the highest amount of asset traffic, you can refer to the heatmap. To see the heatmap, make sure you've selected a Building at the top of the screen first. You can also search for a device to see the heatmap for just that device, which displays information about where the device spends most of its time. To the right of the heatmap, a legend specifies what the colors correspond to. Zoom in to see a detailed breakdown of the traffic, and zoom out for a more general visualization. Any zones you've defined for the floorplan are also marked in blue. #Venue traffic trend The venue traffic trend helps you identify how many devices moved through your venue over the set time period. With this information, you can see potential peaks in productivity and adjust your business operations accordingly. You can also hover over a point on the graph to see the date and number of devices in a tooltip. #Zone traffic trend With the zone traffic trend graph, you can see a breakdown of when your devices are moving between zones. This data is especially useful in helping you identify high traffic areas in your venue and how you can streamline business operations in those areas. You can also hover over a point on the graph to see the name of the zone, date, and number of devices in a tooltip.",

            "content": "Network latency. The Network latency response times tile lets you see which IP addresses or domains have the longest response time or don't respond at all to device requests. This data can help you troubleshoot possible issues related to the application server, for various device groups across the organization. Main tile view The main tile view provides a table of the top 5 IP addresses or website names that take the longest to respond to device requests. In the IP/DNS column, you can click the IP address or DNS to get a drill-down view of the latency data. In the Test type and Response time columns, you'll see the type of request made and the total response time in milliseconds respectively. If you defined a Related app in the Settings > NETWORK tab, you can also see which apps had the longest response times when you hover your cursor over a value in the Response time column. Clicking any IP address or domain name takes you to the Network latency drill-down view. Drill-down view The drill-down view provides two charts to help you analyze network latency trends: Average latency trend, Total latency trend Above the charts, you'll see a ribbon displaying key network latency information. This ribbon provides the following information: Response count - how many times your devices reached the IP address or DNS over the selected reporting period. Average response - the average time it took to get a response from the IP address or DNS over the selected reporting period. Median response time - the mid-value of all response times over the reporting period. Maximum response time - the longest time it took to get a response from an IP address or DNS over the selected reporting period. Minimum response time - the shortest time it took to get a response from an IP address or DNS over the selected reporting period. No response count - the total number of times that an IP or DNS did not respond to a device query over the selected reporting period. #Average latency trend The AVERAGE LATENCY TEST RESPONSE TIME TREND chart lets you see the average time it takes (in milliseconds) to respond to the particular address over the requested data period. Hover your cursor over the graph to view detailed information like the total test count, and average/median/max latency times for each day. #Total latency trend The TOTAL LATENCY TEST COUNTS ABOVE THRESHOLD chart lets you see the total number of times a query took too long to respond - or didn't respond at all - based on the pre-defined latency response time thresholds. Depending on the type of latency test you're conducting (PING, DNS, or TCP), the following values define the lower and upper thresholds for the chart: Lower threshold , PING: 20 ms, DNS: 80 ms, TCP: 1200 ms Upper threshold , PING: 40 ms, DNS: 130 ms, TCP: 1800 ms Hover your cursor over a graph to view the total number of delayed-response or no-response issues per day. Towards the bottom of the chart, you'll find a legend that color-codes the different trend graphs for No response, Lower threshold, and Upper threshold respectively. Click any item in the legend to show or hide the graph on the chart. #Response time per group In the RESPONSE TIME PER GROUP data table below, you'll see a summary of your device groups' network latency data. In the ACTIONS drop-down, you can download a CSV file of the network latency data for groups in your fleet, or for devices in a specific group. ##Download CSV file for groups in your fleet To download the CSV data for groups in the fleet, select one or more groups from the list, then click ACTIONS > Download as CSV. You can also perform this action without selecting a group. If no group is selected, the CSV file will contain data for all groups in the fleet. Once downloaded, the Network_response_time_group_list CSV file provides the same data set from the RESPONSE TIMES PER GROUP table. ##Download CSV file for devices in a specific group To download the CSV data for devices in a specific group, select a single group from the list, then click ACTIONS > Download device list as CSV. If you select more than one group from the list, this action is not available. Once downloaded, the Latency_response_time_device_list CSV file provides a data set different from the RESPONSE TIMES PER GROUP table. In this CSV file, you'll get the following data: IMEI/Serial number - the unique ID for each device. Device group - the group that the devices belong to. Network type - indicates the type of network the tested device was connected to, Wi-Fi or Mobile. Network name - indicates Wi-Fi SSID the device is connected to, or in the case of mobile data, the Network name is null. RSSI (dBm) - The network signal strength. If the device is connected to a mobile network and the user didn't grant Location permission, RSSI has a default value (RSSI: +1). Normal RSSI value is negative (for example, -1). Test type - The latency test type that you configured in Settings (for example: PING/DNS/TCP). Server (IP/Domain) - The URLs that you configured in Settings. Response time (ms) - The length of time it took to get a response from the IP address or DNS server at the time stamp. Timestamp - The time when the device performed latency test.",

How it works To help you monitor and measure how device users are using mobile data, Knox Asset Intelligence collects data about mobile data usage by network generations and carrier. Use information about which network generations your devices are using and for how long to identify potential cost-cutting strategies. For example, device users might primarily be using 4G networks, meaning a 5G data plan could be unnecessary. Knox Asset Intelligence collects the MCC/MNC code and matches it to a carrier name. If the MCC/MNC code doesn't match any carriers in our system, the code may be shown directly in the console instead of the carrier name. Dashboard tile views For a description of the dashboard tiles, refer to Dashboard tiles explained. #Main tile view The Mobile network usage dashboard chart displays cellular signal information arranged by carrier network, providing insight into which network generations - 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G - are used per carrier. The five carriers with the longest cumulative connection durations are shown, along with the percentage of total carrier usage time associated with each network generation. The information also includes the type of cellular network, the connection duration for each network generation, and the cellular usage by carrier. #Expanded view In the expanded view, a line graph features the five mobile carriers that devices connected the longest to. Hover over a point on the graph to see the carrier, number of devices that connected to that carrier, and the total length of time the devices were connected. A breakdown of the total connected time by network generation is also included, along with the total amount of mobile data used by all the devices. A list of carriers is also displayed, which contains the following information about the carriers: CARRIER - The name of the carrier. DEVICE COUNT - The number of devices that connected to the carrier over the selected time period. TOTAL TIME - The total amount of time that all devices were connected to the carrier over the selected time period. 5G - The total amount of time that devices connected to the carrier's 5G network, and its percentage of connection time compared to that of all network generations. 4G - The total amount of time that devices connected to the carrier's 4G network, and its percentage of connection time compared to that of all network generations. 3G - The total amount of time that devices connected to the carrier's 3G network, and its percentage of connection time compared to that of all network generations. 2G - The total amount of time that devices connected to the carrier's 2G network, and its percentage of connection time compared to that of all network generations. TOTAL MOBILE DATA USAGE - The total amount of mobile data used by all devices for the carrier. If you have devices that haven't reported any SIM information, you'll see those devices and their usage data under a carrier called N/A.

            "content": "Wi-Fi disconnection events. How it works On Samsung devices, a Wi-Fi module runs at the system level to detect issues. Abnormal Wi-Fi disconnection events are broadcast to the Knox Asset Intelligence agent and uploaded to the server in real time. Use these insights to identify exactly why your devices are disconnected, and conduct a root cause analysis with the historical trends that Knox Asset Intelligence provides. The categories of Wi-Fi disconnection events are: Disconnection category Event Troubleshooting action Device internal fail Abnormal disconnect from conventional field (LCD on) The root cause is difficult to determine through the device. If this event occurs repeatedly, please check the access point. Disabled by an AP Association Reject event An additional review of device logs and the access point is required to determine the exact cause of an Association Reject event. One potential cause may be the MAC security configuration - ensure you either set the MAC security category of the access point or disable MAC security. Disabled due to an authentication (Wrong Password) Make sure you enter the correct password. Passwords are case-sensitive and may include letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces. Scan fails more than 3 times in 3 minutes If this event occurs repeatedly, there may be internal issues in the device. Device logs are required for further troubleshooting. Driver HANG occurs If this event occurs repeatedly, there may be internal device driver issues. Device logs are required for further troubleshooting. HIDL communication problem occurred If this event occurs repeatedly, there may be internal device driver issues. Device logs are required for further troubleshooting. Indistinct AP event Abnormal disconnect from conventional field (LCD on) The root cause is difficult to determine through the device. If this event occurs repeatedly, please check the access point. Disabled by an AP Association Reject event An additional review of the device logs and access point is required to determine the exact cause of an Association Reject event. One potential cause may be the MAC security configuration &mdash; ensure you either set the MAC security category of the access point or disable MAC security. Disabled due to an authentication (Wrong Password) Make sure you enter the correct password. Passwords are case-sensitive and may include letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces. DHCP Wrong IP address given by AP The dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) failure may be caused by a problem in the access point's DHCP server configuration, or by a wide area network (WAN) port problem or another DHCP server. For example, another port may be connected instead of the WAN port. To determine the exact cause, an additional review of the device logs and access point is required. DHCP fail (Need to check air log) Check whether the DHCP server is configured in the access point, and if the IP is properly allocated. AP Abnormal cause message sent by AP There was a general disconnection from the access point. If this event occurs repeatedly, please check the access point. Unreceivable packets sent by AP There was a general disconnection from the access point. If this event occurs repeatedly, please check the access point. WIPS action Caused by control system (MDM, EMM) Wireless network connections may be blocked by a control system, such as an EMM. Contact your network administrator for assistance. A WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System) guards against Wi-Fi threats that could potentially cause security breaches, such as unauthorized access points. 3rd Party App Caused by 3rd Party App A third-party app may be interfering with Wi-Fi operation. Device logs are required for further troubleshooting. WIFI status has not changed A third-party app may be interfering with Wi-Fi operation. Device logs are required for further troubleshooting. By default, event logs are uploaded to the server once every three hours. You can configure this time interval through your Dashboard settings. Dashboard tile views For a description of the dashboard tiles, refer to Dashboard tiles explained. #Main tile view Knox Asset Intelligence provides two Wi-Fi disconnection charts - one that categorizes disconnection events by group, and another that categorizes them by BSSID. Events are arranged in descending order. The five groups and BSSIDs with the highest number of abnormal disconnections are shown. For event descriptions associated with the above categories, refer to How it works. You can also hover over a bar in the chart to see the distribution of events within that category, or hover over a BSSID name to see the human-friendly access point names associated with that BSSID. At the bottom of each chart, you can check which groups, BSSIDs, or devices have exceeded the issue thresholds. Click VIEW next to one of the insights to go to a Drill-down view of all affected assets of that type. Click Expand to see a list of all groups or BSSIDs that recorded Wi-Fi disconnection events over the configured time range. You can choose between Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, and Last 14 days for the time range. #Expanded view The expanded view displays a list of BSSIDs and their associated Wi-Fi disconnection events. At the top, the time range follows the global time range set in the console - any events occurring outside of this range aren't displayed. You can also adjust the time range through the list at the top. The total number of BSSIDs, SSIDs, APs, disconnection events, and impacted groups and devices are also listed in the page description below the title. Under certain categories, you can click View all to jump to a list of impacted devices, groups, or BSSIDs. If you're viewing the Groups chart, the following information is available: DEVICE GROUP - The name of the device group. EVENT COUNT - The number of disconnection events. Click the event count number to view a list of affected devices. BSSID COUNT - The number of affected BSSIDs. DEVICE COUNT - The number of devices that reported a disconnection event. If you're viewing the BSSIDs/APs chart, the following information is available: BSSID - The access point's basic service set identifier, used to uniquely identify it. AP - The friendly name given to the BSSID. EVENT COUNT - The number of disconnection events. Click the event count number to view a list of affected devices. IMPACTED DEVICES - The number of devices that reported a disconnection event. SSID - The name of the network. AP VENDOR - The name of the access point provider. AP TYPE - The type of access point. For example, a Passpoint or carrier-supported network. BANDS - The frequency band associated with the Wi-Fi channel. DEVICE GROUP - The device group associated with the access point. #Drill down view Three drill-down views are available to show additional information about abnormal disconnection events for troubleshooting. If the time range is set to Today or Yesterday, no chart is available. For the Last 30 days and Last 60 days time ranges, neither the chart nor the table info are available. Depending on whether you choose to view events associated with a BSSID, device group, or device, the list view differs slightly. The available list data includes the following: DEVICE ID - The IMEI/MEID or serial number of the device. This information is only shown when viewing events by access point. DEVICE GROUP - The name of the group the device belongs to. BSSID - The access point's basic service set identifier, used to uniquely identify it. This identifier is only shown when viewing events by device ID. AP - The friendly name given to the BSSID. SSID - The name of the network. This category is only shown when viewing events by device ID. DISCONNECTION CATEGORY - The Wi-Fi disconnection category that the event belongs to. See How it works for a list of disconnection categories. DISCONNECTION EVENT - A brief description of the disconnection cause. See How it works for additional information on each event. 802.11 REASON - The error description corresponding to an IEEE 802.11 code. Refer to IEEE 802.11 codes for more information. EVENT TIME - The time the event occurred, in the format _DD/MM/YYYY 00:00/City_. DISCONNECTION EVENT LOG - If available, a log of the device's disconnection events that can be downloaded. If you want to obtain details about a device's disconnection events, click DOWNLOAD DISCONNECTION EVENT LOG at the top of the device list. This button is only enabled if the device has a disconnection event log file available for download. Device logs are collected when an event constitutes more than 10% of the total disconnection events for the selected time period. To view logs that were generated prior to Knox Asset Intelligence 22.08, use a decoder tool on the file. Any logs generated after that version don't need to be decoded. You can use the search bar above the list to search for a specific device ID or BSSID. You can also click the Filter icon to show the filter panel, where you can sort data by specific parameters. Information in the chart is filtered according to the parameters you specify in this panel. For details about Wi-Fi disconnection events and suggested actions to resolve them, see How it works and IEEE 802.11 codes. IEEE 802.11 codes IEEE 802.11 provides the technical standard for devices communicating across wireless networks. The standard provides a type of error code called a _reason code_, which describes why a device failed to connect to an access point. When a connectivity issue is logged, the Knox Asset Intelligence console may display a reason code to help you troubleshoot the problem. The following table lists all possible reason codes you may encounter. Reason code , 802.11 reason - , - 0 , Unknown 1 , Unspecified reason 2 , Previous authentication no longer valid 3 , Station is leaving (or has left) IBSS or ESS 4 , Disassociated due to inactivity 5 , Disassociated because AP is unable to handle all currently associated stations 6 , Class 2 frame received from nonauthenticated station 7 , Class 3 frame received from nonassociated station 8 , Disassociated because sending station is leaving (or has left) BSS 9 , Station requesting (re)association is not authenticated with responding station 10 , Disassociated because the information in the Power Capability element is unacceptable 11 , Disassociated because the information in the Supported Channels element is unacceptable 12 , Disassociated due to BSS transition management 13 , Invalid information element, i.e. an information element defined in this standard for which the content does not meet the specifications in Clause 9 14 , Message integrity code (MIC) failure 15 , 4-Way Handshake timeout 16 , Group Key Handshake timeout 17 , Information element in 4-Way Handshake different from (Re)Association Request/Probe Response/Beacon frame 18 , Invalid group ciphe 19 , Invalid pairwise ciphe 20 , Invalid AKMP 21 , Unsupported RSN information element version 22 , Invalid RSN information element capabilities 23 , IEEE 802.1X authentication failed 24 , Cipher suite rejected because of the security policy 25 , TDLS direct-link teardown due to TDLS peer STA unreachable via the TDLS direct link 26 , TDLS direct-link teardown for unspecified reason 27 , Disassociated because session terminated by SSP request 28 , Disassociated because of lack of SSP roaming agreement 29 , Requested service rejected because of SSP cipher suite or AKM requirement 30 , Requested service not authorized in this location 31 , TS deleted because QoS AP lacks sufficient bandwidth for this QoS STA due to a change in BSS service characteristics or operational mode 32 , Disassociated for unspecified, QoS-related reason 33 , Disassociated because QAP lacks sufficient bandwidth for this QSTA 34 , Disassociated because excessive number of frames need to be acknowledged, but are not acknowledged due to AP transmissions and/or poor channel conditions 35 , Disassociated because QSTA is transmitting outside the limits of its TXOPs 36 , Requesting STA is leaving the BSS (or resetting) 37 , Requesting STA is no longer using the stream or session 38 , Requesting STA received frames using a mechanism for which a setup has not been completed 39 , Requested from peer STA due to timeout 45 , Peer STA does not support the requested cipher suite 46 , In a DLS Teardown frame: The teardown was initiated by the DLS peer / In a Disassociation frame: Disassociated because authorized access limit reached 47 , In a DLS Teardown frame: The teardown was initiated by the AP / In a Disassociation frame: Disassociated due to external service requirements 48 , Invalid FT Action frame count 49 , Invalid pairwise master key identifier (PMKID) 50 , Invalid MDE 51 , Invalid FTE 52 , Mesh peering canceled for unknown reasons 53 , The mesh STA has reached the supported maximum number of peer mesh STAs 54 , The received information violates the Mesh Configuration policy configured in the mesh STA profile 55 , The mesh STA has received a Mesh Peering Close frame requesting to close the mesh peering. 56 , The mesh STA has resent dot11MeshMaxRetries Mesh Peering Open frames, without receiving a Mesh Peering Confirm frame. 57 , The confirmTimer for the mesh peering instance times out. 58 , The mesh STA fails to unwrap the GTK or the values in the wrapped contents do not match 59 , The mesh STA receives inconsistent information about the mesh parameters between mesh peering Management frames 60 , The mesh STA fails the authenticated mesh peering exchange because due to failure in selecting either the pairwise cipher suite or group cipher suite 61 , The mesh STA does not have proxy information for this external destination. 62 , The mesh STA does not have forwarding information for this destination. 63 , The mesh STA determines that the link to the next hop of an active path in its forwarding information is no longer usable. 64 , The Deauthentication frame was sent because the MAC address of the STA already exists in the mesh BSS.

Review Bulk upload or delete devices for more information. Step 3: Enroll your devices After IMEIs are added to your console, you'll need to ensure that data actually gets sent from the devices to the Knox Asset Intelligence server. To do this, you'll need to enroll the devices in the Knox Asset Intelligence service. There are several ways to enroll devices: 1. Install the agent from Google Play. 2. Deploy the agent with an EMM. 3. Enroll through OOBE (Out-of-box-experience). Review the Enroll devices guide for instructions on each method. Once your devices are enrolled, you can start viewing business insights for them in your Knox Asset Intelligence dashboard. Step 4: Use the Dashboard Now that your devices are enrolled, you can start viewing data in the Knox Asset Intelligence Dashboard - a hub for all your device insights. Here is where you'll find at-a-glance views of your fleet's health, organized into easy-to-use tiles. Launching your Dashboard is easy - simply click Dashboard from the left navigation pane. By default, the Dashboard displays tiles related to network, app, and battery health, all together in the same view, without any additional setup. The Device statuses tile is where you can see how many devices you have in the Knox Asset Intelligence console, and how many of those devices are enrolled and actively reporting data to the server. The following statuses are shown in this tile: Pending - Reseller-uploaded devices are awaiting your approval. Approve uploads by going to the Devices page's Uploads tab. Not enrolled - Devices uploaded to the console but not yet enrolled in the Knox Asset Intelligence server. See Enroll devices to learn more. Failed to enroll - Devices that encountered an error during enrollment. Check whether the license is valid, or whether the device's Knox version is valid. You can check the detailed reason for failure by going to the Devices page and selecting ACTIONS > View device log. If you're still experiencing enrollment issues, please visit Samsung Knox Support. Enrolled - All devices enrolled in Knox Asset Intelligence that have consumed a license seat. Active - Enrolled devices that are working as expected. Inactive - Enrolled devices that have not communicated with the Knox Asset Intelligence server for 7 or more consecutive days. Checks whether devices are powered off or not connected to a mobile network. Expired - The license associated with the device is expired, and the device is not reporting any data. Renew your Knox Asset Intelligence associated license. Next to the Device Statuses tile, Today's issues gives you an at-a-glance view of device issues that occurred during the day. These insights help you take immediate action on issues and avoid device downtime. If you want to customize the dashboard to only display tiles that matter to your organization, you can do so in the Dashboard settings page. To do this: 1. Click Settings in the top-right corner of the Dashboard. 2. On the Settings page, click the CUSTOMIZE tab, then select or clear the tiles that you're interested in seeing on your dashboard. The Device statuses and Today's issues tiles can't be removed from the Dashboard. 3. Click SAVE to return to the Dashboard page. 4. Back on the Dashboard page, use the date selector to set a date range for which you want to see device data. The selection is global, which means you'll see data for the same date range on all tiles. 5. Rearrange your tiles by clicking and dragging anywhere along the top of each tile. #Dashboard tiles explained With your Dashboard all set up, you can now interact with the different tiles to get insight into your fleet's performance. Most Dashboard tiles have a similar structure consisting of: 1. The main data set displaying a table or chart of the top issues or events. 2. An option to either view expanded data insights or Dashboard settings. 3. A notification section that lets you know when data thresholds are reached, as well as other important information related to your insight. See Dashboard settings: Thresholds for more information. 4. A date and time stamp for the last update, and a manual refresh button to request new data. See Data refresh cycles to learn more. #Main tile view Most dashboard tiles display their key data insights in the form of charts, tables, or lists. Some tiles like the Apps with most issues provide both a chart and a list to provide greater detail into the insight Just below the main data set, you might see alerts, notifications, or other important information related to your insight. Some dashboard insights display notifications when critical event thresholds are reached (for example, when apps use more than 100MB of mobile data per day), while others display the top issue, app, or group contributing to the insight (for example, letting you know the most used app across your entire fleet). Near the bottom-right corner of each tile, you'll see the last date and time data got refreshed. Some tiles like Today's issues allow you to refresh data on demand. If a tile has a Refresh icon next to the timestamp, you can click the icon to request the latest data from the server. #Expanded view To help you analyze critical issues in greater detail, most Dashboard tiles provide an _expanded_ view of the data set. To see an insight's expanded view, click the > button near to top-right corner of the tile. Depending on the insight, some expanded views include a chart of the most critical issues near the top of the page, and a table detailing all issues near the bottom. Others might just display information in a table (without a chart). For example, the expanded view for Apps with highest battery consumption shows the top 5 worst performing apps, and their consumed battery power percentage over the selected reporting period. While the chart only displays the top 5 worst apps, the table below displays every app that has consumed excessive battery over the same reporting period. Most insights allow you to filter the data set and download a CSV file of the data from the expanded view. If the option is available, click the Filter icon to open the filter panel and select specific parameters, then click Apply to save your changes. The page updates and shows only the filtered results, and filter tags appear above the data. To remove the filters and restore the default settings, click CLEAR ALL FILTERS. If available, you can click the CUSTOMIZE TABLE button ( ... ) to show or hide columns in your table. Note that some columns are mandatory and cannot be hidden, and some insights only allow you to display up to 7 columns at a time. And if the CSV option is available, you can click DOWNLOAD AS CSV to export the table in CSV format. The columns in the CSV file will match the columns in the table. #Drill-down view For some insights, you can get an even deeper analysis of the data by clicking certain key-values in the expanded-view table. This will open a _drill-down_ view for those values, providing additional details not found in the insight's expanded view. For example, in the expanded view table for Apps with highest battery consumption, the key-values are the applications in the APP column. Clicking any link in the APP column takes you to a drill-down view for that application, letting you see extended details like which _versions_ of the app consume the most battery power, and how many _devices_ are running each version. Like with the expanded view, you can also use the filter (if available) to focus on specific data, customize your table, or download the table as a CSV file for offline viewing. #Next steps Now that you know how to launch Knox Asset Intelligence and use the Dashboard, expand your knowledge by reviewing the various how-to guide topics or watching the how-to video.

            "content": "Enroll devices. There are several ways to enroll your devices in Knox Asset Intelligence. To start, you need to install the Knox Asset Intelligence agent on the devices through one of the following methods:, Install the agent from Google Play, Enroll with an EMM, Enroll with OOBE (out-of-box experience) Enrollment steps #Enroll with an EMM You can easily deploy the Knox Asset Intelligence agent to your devices through your EMM and the Google Play Store. The following procedures prescribe the general actions you need to perform on your EMM - refer to your EMM's documentation for more precise descriptions of how to accomplish these actions. Before you proceed, ensure the Knox Service Plugin is enabled for your EMM first. To enroll a device in Knox Asset Intelligence with most EMMs: 1. Sign in to your EMM console. 2. In an Android Enterprise device profile or payload, add Knox Asset Intelligence on public Google Play as an app. 3. (Optional) If you want to collect location data on your devices, set the app permission policy to Grant. If your devices are running Android 12 or higher, permissions are granted differently based on your device management mode. For fully managed deployments, EMMs can pre-grant location permissions during enrollment. For work profile on company-owned device deployments, device users must manually grant location permissions to the agent when prompted before Knox Asset Intelligence can collect location data from the device. 4. Assign the Knox Asset Intelligence agent to your profile. Make sure to configure the app to auto-launch after installation. 5. Save the device profile or payload and assign it to the target devices. To enroll a device in Knox Asset Intelligence with Knox Manage (KM): 1. Sign in to the KM console. 2. Begin following the instructions in Add public applications using Google Play Store. 3. In Step 4, enter Knox Asset Intelligence as the app to add. 4. On the Assign Application page, set Auto-run after installation to Yes. 5. Go to Profile. 6. Create a new Android Enterprise profile, or edit an existing one. 7. On the Set Policy page, go to Application. 8. (Optional) If you want to collect location data on your devices, for the App Permission policy, set the Device Controls and Work Profile Controls to Grant. If your devices are running Android 12 or higher, permissions are granted differently based on your device management mode. For fully managed deployments, EMMs can pre-grant location permissions during enrollment. For work profile on company-owned device deployments, device users must manually grant location permissions to the agent when prompted before Knox Asset Intelligence can collect location data from the device. 9. Click Save & Assign. The Assign Profile page opens. 10. Select the group or organization to assign the app to, then click Assign & Apply. #Enroll with OOBE Knox Asset Intelligence also supports out-of-box experience (OOBE), allowing you to automatically enroll devices when the device is turned on for the first time, or after a factory reset. When the device is turned on during OOBE, the Knox enrollment service checks whether the device: Was uploaded by a reseller,, Is registered in Knox Asset Intelligence with the Not enrolled status, and, Has the auto-enrollment feature enabled. If the device user has already completed the setup wizard, the device must be enrolled either manually or through an EMM policy. If the three preceding pre-conditions are satisfied, the enrollment service attempts to download the Knox Asset Intelligence agent. If the agent download fails, a notification prompts the device user to retry the download. This notification persists until the download is complete. If the device successfully installs the agent, the agent launches in the background and automatically starts the enrollment process, regardless of whether it received runtime permissions. On devices with a work profile, the agent installs in the work profile. A notification displays on the device while enrollment is in progress. In the event of an enrollment failure, the device notifies the user. They can either tap Retry on the notification or manually launch the agent to attempt enrollment again. Depending on your device's enrollment type, the device either asks for or receives runtime permissions before enrollment. If location permissions aren't granted to the agent, a notification prompts the device user to grant location permissions with options to Allow or Deny. Regardless of the device user's choice, only location data collection is affected - enrollment isn't impacted. If location tracking is disabled in the Knox Asset Intelligence console, device users are not prompted for location permissions after enrollment. #Auto-enrollment Devices enrolling in Knox Asset Intelligence through OOBE must be explicitly granted permission to do so from either: The Resellers menu, The Devices menu Only admins with the Manage devices permission can enable or disable auto-enrollment for devices. ##In the Resellers menu If you configured a reseller to automatically approve all device uploads from a reseller, you can also choose to automatically enroll those devices when they're turned on for the first time: 1. In the Resellers menu, select a reseller name. 2. In the reseller details panel, enable Automatically enroll all devices uploaded from this reseller when devices are turned on for the first time (out-of-box experience). This option is only available if Automatically approve all devices uploaded by this reseller is also enabled. 3. Click SAVE. Current and future uploads from the reseller are then set to automatically enroll through OOBE, and have the Enabled status. ##In the Devices menu The device list shows the auto-enrollment status of each device, which is either Enabled or Disabled. You can also click a device ID to check this status through the device details. In the Devices menu, you can enable or disable auto-enrollment for devices by: Selecting one or more devices not in the Pending status and clicking Actions > Enable auto-enrollment or Disable auto-enrollment,, Uploading a CSV file containing devices you want to enable or disable auto-enrollment for, o, Enabling Automatically enroll all devices uploaded from this reseller when devices are turned on for the first time (out-of-box experience) for a device upload in the Uploads tab. If you want to upload a CSV file containing devices to enable or disable auto-enrollment for: 1. In the BULK ACTIONS tab, select ENABLE AUTO-ENROLLMENT or DISABLE AUTO-ENROLLMENT. 2. Using the provided template, upload a CSV file with only device IDs. Devices with the Pending status or that are uploaded through CSV can't have their auto-enrollment status changed. By default, current devices and all subsequent devices that are approved have auto-enrollment disabled. If you want your devices to automatically enroll after a factory reset or when they're turned on for the first time, enable auto-enrollment for them. Enrollment flows Depending on which method you choose, the enrollment process differs slightly. This section describes the different enrollment flows you might encounter, based on your device fleet and preferred deployment mode. Knox Asset Intelligence supports the following deployment modes and enrollment methods: 1. Fully managed devices enrolled through an EMM 2. Devices with a work profile enrolled through an EMM 3. Fully managed devices enrolled through OOBE 4. Devices with a work profile enrolled through OOBE If you disabled location tracking in the dashboard settings, device users aren't prompted to grant location permissions during or after enrollment. #Enrolling fully managed devices through an EMM If you're enrolling devices in fully managed mode through an EMM, you can pre-grant location permissions and skip prompting the device user for them. If you pre-granted location permissions and Knox Asset Intelligence is set to auto-launch through the Knox Service Plugin: 1. Enrollment starts in the background. 2. After enrollment completes, the agent pushes a notification. 3. If the device user taps the notification, the Knox Asset Intelligence terms & conditions are shown. 4. If the device user taps Continue, the agent status information displays. If you pre-granted location permissions and Knox Asset Intelligence is set to auto-launch through your EMM: 1.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Integrate with an MSP. How it works Managed service providers (MSPs) can manage devices in Knox Asset Intelligence on behalf of your company, through the Knox MSP Portal. There are two ways you can be managed by an MSP: Fully managed - You won't be able to access the Knox Asset Intelligence console. This option is intended to be a complete end-to-end solution, with your MSP offering hardware, apps, security, and support. Jointly managed - You can still access the Knox Asset Intelligence console, which you manage alongside your MSP. This option is ideal for companies that are looking to outsource some of their IT management work. As a jointly managed customer, if you decide not to be managed by your MSP in the future, they can initiate a delink request to stop managing your Knox Asset Intelligence console. Once you accept the request in the Knox Admin Portal, you then gain full control over your devices, settings, and data. Location data can't be managed by MSPs. For more details on how the Knox MSP Program works, refer to the MSP admin guide. #New Knox Asset Intelligence customers If you haven't signed up for Knox Asset Intelligence yet and want to be managed by an MSP, you can ask your MSP to register your company as a new customer in the Knox MSP Portal. If you or someone else in your company eventually want to change settings or view the dashboard directly, you'll need to ask your MSP to give you full access permissions when they create your account. Afterwards, you're directed to sign up for a Samsung account and Knox account through email. #Existing Knox Asset Intelligence customers If you're already using Knox Asset Intelligence and are interested in being managed by an MSP, your MSP can initiate the setup process in the Knox MSP Portal. Afterwards, your company's super admin will receive an email with an invitation to accept the management request. Once the super admin signs in to the Knox Admin Portal and accepts the request, the following happens depending on the selected management type: Fully managed - You're no longer able to access your Knox Asset Intelligence console, and your MSP receives service-related emails instead. Your MSP also has access to all data associated with your Knox Asset Intelligence console, including information about devices, licenses, resellers, and so on. Jointly managed - You can still manage your Knox Asset Intelligence console, and both you and your MSP receive service-related emails. Your MSP won't be able to manage your administrators and roles. Note that your MSP can't be a device group manager. In other words, if email alerts are set to be sent to all admins, then your MSP receives alerts for the whole company. However, if email alerts are set to be sent only to device group managers, your MSP admin can only can get email alerts for all device groups if their admin email is listed as an additional recipient. Therefore, if you want to receive group-level reports from Knox Asset Intelligence as an MSP admin, you need to add your email as an additional recipient. To do so: 1. In the top-right corner of the Knox Admin Portal, click your account icon > Settings. 2. Under KNOX ASSET INTELLIGENCE, click EMAIL PREFERENCES. 3. For each issue category you want to receive emails for, under Recipients, select Additional recipients and enter your email in the search box.",

For dual-SIM devices, both IMEIs are supported. Device information The Devices page is where you can perform all device-related actions. The device list contains the following information. The table can be customized by clicking the table menu icon (...) and selecting table columns to display, up to a maximum of 7. 1. DEVICE ID - The device's unique identifier. If the device supports two SIMs, only the primary IMEI (IMEI1) is shown, but you can search for the device using either IMEI. 2. DEVICE GROUP - The name of the group the device belongs to. 3. MODEL - The device's model code. 4. STATUS - The current status of the device. 5. PERMISSIONS - Indicates whether the device user has granted location permissions. If the device does not have location permissions, you can send a permission notification by clicking ACTIONS > Send permission notification. If your devices are running Android 12 or higher, permissions are granted differently based on your device management mode. For device owner (DO) deployments, EMMs can pre-grant location permissions during enrollment. For work profile on company-owned device deployments, device users must manually grant location permissions through an alert in the notification panel before Knox Asset Intelligence can collect location data from the device. If the user denies location permissions, then Wi-Fi and location data can't be collected from their device. 6. BATTERY STATUS - The device's current battery status. 7. BATTERY SOH - The overall health of the device's battery. Click a DEVICE ID to bring up a sliding panel with extended details, including a device summary, app, battery, and Wi-Fi connection information, as well as device logs. If a device hasn't reported new data to the Knox servers yet, you might not see some of these details in the console. As an example scenario, app information would be unavailable for a device if said device hasn't reported any app usage data. You can also search for a device or group by entering a device ID or group name in the search bar. Uploads The Uploads tab shows any Samsung devices you've purchased from a reseller, after the reseller uploads them to your console. On this tab, you can approve the uploads and add the devices to your device list. Ensure you've registered your reseller in the Knox Asset Intelligence console beforehand. #Bulk upload or delete devices If your devices were not purchased from a reseller, you can use a CSV file to manually upload or delete devices from Knox Asset Intelligence. To do so: 1. In the navigation pane, click Devices. 2. In Devices screen, click the BULK ACTIONS tab. 3. Click UPLOAD DEVICES or DELETE DEVICES to take either action. You can also find CSV instructions underneath the bulk action options. 4. In the BULK ACTIONS, select UPLOAD DEVICES or DELETE DEVICES depending on whether you chose to upload or delete devices. 5. In the dialog that's shown, download the CSV template. In the template, enter one device IMEI per line (up to a maximum of 10 000 devices), then save your file. 6. Go back to the dialog in the Knox Asset Intelligence console. Under Select .csv file\\*, click BROWSE to locate your CSV file in the file explorer. 7. After selecting your file, click SUBMIT. In the top-right corner, a notification confirms that your devices were uploaded or deleted successfully. Groups Knox Asset Intelligence offers a GROUPS tab where you can view and manage your device group information. The GROUPS list displays the following info: 1. DEVICE GROUP - The name of the device group. Click a group name to open a sliding panel with fields to edit the group description and the list of managers. 2. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the group. For long descriptions, hover over the truncated description to see the full text. 3. DEVICE COUNT - The number of devices in the group. Click a number to go to a filtered list of devices belonging to that group. 4. MANAGERS - The number of managers assigned to the group, who are admins with permission to manage groups. Managers can receive alert emails when Wi-Fi or app stability events exceed the thresholds set for the device group. 5. MODIFIED - The date and time the group was last edited. There are two ways to upload device group information to Knox Asset Intelligence: Using existing group IDs from an EMM, Through a CSV upload If you use both methods to upload device group information, the EMM group information supersedes the CSV upload. #Using existing group IDs from an EMM ##For organizations using VMware Workspace ONE UEM If you modify or delete a group in your EMM after uploading a CSV file, your Knox Asset Intelligence group data may be affected. Knox Asset Intelligence supports dynamically-generated group IDs, also referred to as lookup fields, that simplify the group syncing experience between Knox Asset Intelligence and VMware Workspace One UEM. Workspace ONE UEM provides lookup values that can be used instead of static group ID values, which represent an element of the device or user that you might not normally have access to. For example, you might want to group several Galaxy XCover Pro devices together in Knox Asset Intelligence. Instead of creating a dedicated group in Workspace ONE UEM, you can select device model as a lookup field to find all XCover Pro devices in your fleet, which then auto-syncs to Knox Asset Intelligence as a device group. Refer to VMware's documentation for a full list of supported lookup values. You can also create Custom Lookup Fields using regular expressions, which let you assign friendly names to your lookup fields. Learn more in the VMware documentation. On the Workspace ONE UEM console, once you define a standard or custom lookup field for group IDs, enter it in the Application Configuration menu for the Knox Asset Intelligence agent. Doing so sets the lookup field as a dynamically-generated group ID for each device. Note that the application configuration is pushed through Managed Google Play. Once the application configuration is pushed to the enrolled devices, the Knox Asset Intelligence agent receives the group ID through VMware Hub and automatically assigns the device to the designated group. You can then see the device group and assignment on the Knox Asset Intelligence console. ##For organizations using other EMMs In other EMMs that don't support lookup fields, you can manually enter group IDs in the application configuration section. #Through a CSV upload If your devices aren't grouped through an EMM or you prefer to manually define your device groups, you can upload a CSV file containing device IDs and group names to the Knox Asset Intelligence console. To group devices: 1. In the left sidebar of your Knox Asset Intelligence console, click Devices. 2. On the Devices screen, select the GROUPS tab. 3. To the right of the search bar, click GROUP DEVICES. 4. On the Device grouping screen, download the CSV template. Enter a device IMEI and a venue name per line in the template (up to a maximum of 10,000 devices), then save your file. 5. Under Select .csv file\\*, click BROWSE to locate your CSV file in the file explorer. 6. After selecting your file, click SUBMIT. If one or more of your devices can't be enrolled, a notification is shown in the top-right corner with a download link to a CSV file containing error details.",

            "last_updated": "2023-09-06",
            "content": "Use the agent app. The Knox Asset Intelligence agent runs on the device and is responsible for collecting device information to send to the Knox cloud server. When a device user launches the agent, the main screen displays the agent version, name of the group the device belongs to, and enrollment status. The following actions are available: Device status - Displays device information, including the IMEI and firmware version. Error reports - Generates system logs to submit to the Knox Asset Intelligence console. The device user is prompted to enter a category and description before submission. Diagnostics - Displays Wi-Fi, battery, and app information related to the device. Legal information - Displays legal disclaimers pertaining to the use of Knox Asset Intelligence. Open source licenses - Displays the open source licenses used by Knox Asset Intelligence. Per Google's design, whenever the Knox Asset Intelligence agent is active, a Knox Asset Intelligence is running notification displays in the notification drawer. You can hide it through the device's notification settings. Device status When the device user selects Device status from the agent's main screen, the device's information is shown. As an IT admin, you can use this information to quickly verify and troubleshoot issues without requesting device logs every time. The device information includes the following: Model name, Model numbe, IMEI, Serial numbe, Android OS version, Firmware version, Android security patch level, Knox version, Display resolution, Display density, Wi-Fi MAC address, Bluetooth address, Storage, RAM Error reports When the device user selects Error reports, system debug logs are generated that can be uploaded to your Knox Asset Intelligence console. The debug logs contain system diagnostics information and system message logs that can help you identify the root cause of an issue. You can also capture tcpdump logs for advanced network troubleshooting between device and app servers. Any uploaded device debug logs are deleted from the Knox Asset Intelligence servers after 30 days by default. Before submission, the device user must first select one of the following categories for the error report: All, Battery, App, Wi-Fi, Device operation, Network (TCPDUMP) Then, they're prompted to enter a detailed description for the issue. The description is limited to 500 characters. Once the two fields are filled, the device user can then send the logs to the Knox cloud server. The logs can't be submitted if either one of the fields is empty. After the device user successfully sends the log file, you can view it in the Diagnostic device logs menu on the Knox Asset Intelligence console. Send a tcpdump log This feature is only available on devices running Android 12 (S) or higher. To help you troubleshoot more complicated network issues, Knox Asset Intelligence uses the tcpdump tool to get network traffic data directly from the device, which device users can then send to you as a tcpdump log. This log records all packet information that the device is transmitting or receiving over the network. If the device user selects Network (TCPDUMP) as the error category, after they enter your description and tap Send, they're prompted to confirm whether they want to start capturing a tcpdump log. They also need to acknowledge that some sensitive information might also be captured before they can continue. If they tap Start capturing, the device user then needs to reproduce the issue they encountered within 5 minutes. Floating action buttons are shown with options to cancel or stop the capturing process. Tapping the cancel button or exceeding the 5-minute time limit discards the log and ends the capture session, and you'll see a Couldn't reproduce status in the console. After the device user replicates the situation the issue occurred in, they can tap the stop button to end log capturing. They're then asked whether they want to send the log to you, and are given options to Start over or Send. Tcpdump logs are deleted after 30 days by default, but you have the ability to delete them manually in the Knox Asset Intelligence console. Diagnostics To help troubleshoot issues further, device users can use the agent's Diagnostics feature to get more detailed information about their device's Wi-Fi, battery, and app-related behavior, then take actions to share this information or send error reports to IT admins for further analysis. To begin, the device user needs to tap the Diagnostic button on their app home screen, then tap the option that they want to perform diagnostics with: Wi-Fi, Battery, Apps, Mobile network #Wi-Fi After selecting Wi-Fi, two tabs are available at the bottom of the screen. Status - Displays the signal strength, band, SSID, signal, IP, device MAC address, and access point MAC address of device's current Wi-Fi connection. If Wi-Fi roaming is detected, additional roaming information is displayed. The signal strength is shown in real-time as a graph, with three statuses indicating the network latency. The status ranges are as follows: Status , Strength , , - , - , , Excellent , -67 dBm or higher , , Very good , -68 dBm to -70 dBm , , Okay , -71 dBm to -80 dBm , , Not good , -81 dBm to -90 dBm , , Unusable , -91 dBm or lower , , Test - Allows the device user to send various commands to the Wi-Fi network to test for connectivity issues. The results of these tests can be shared with you for troubleshooting purposes. Single Ping - Sends a single ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request to the network host. After the device user enters a DNS or IP address, the ping result is returned. For example, if com is entered as the DNS, it tries to request three packets at once. Assuming samsungknox.com receives three packets, the ping result shows 3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss. No packet loss indicates that data is reaching its destination properly. There may be a slight delay before the results are returned. Continual Ping - Sends a looping ICMP echo request to the network host, which you can configure the settings for. After the device user enters a DNS or IP address, the ping result is returned. For example, if com is entered as the DNS, it continuously requests one packet at a time. Assuming samsungknox.com receives six packets, the ping result shows Sent: 6, Received: 6, Missed: 0. No packet loss indicates that data is reaching its destination properly. There may be a slight delay before the results are returned. NSLookup - Queries the DNS servers for the domain mapping to the IP address. After the device user enters a DNS or IP address, the DNS records for the domain name are returned. For example, if com is entered as the DNS, its host name, canonical name, IP address, and network latency are shown. Network status - Displays the details of the device's connected network, including the host name, domain, IP address, mask, broadcast, gateway, DHCP info, WLAN DNS, and lease time. If the device is using a proxy, that information is also displayed. Scan SSID - Displays the signal strength, access point MAC address, and band of the SSID the device is currently connected to. Known network - Displays a list of all Wi-Fi networks the device has previously connected to. The device user can also generate and send debug logs to you by selecting Error report in the top-right corner of the screen. ##Change the continual ping test settings To change the continual ping settings, the device user can tap the settings next to Continual Ping. The following settings are available: Count - The total number of packets to request. The default value is 10, but a number from 4 to 1000 can be entered. Interval (ms) - The interval of time, in milliseconds, between successive packet transmissions. The default value is 1000, but a number from 200 to 2000 can be entered. Timeout (ms) - The length of time, in milliseconds, that a response needs to be received within before a connection timeout is reported. The default value is 500, but a number from 10 to 1000 can be entered. Max TTL - The maximum amount of time, or time to live (TTL), in seconds, that a packet can exist in a network before being discarded by the router. The default value is 64, but a number from 49 to 255 can be entered. Packet size - The size of the packet to request, in bytes. The default value is 64, but a number from 4 to 1472 can be entered. If the device user sets Packet size as 10, Interval (ms) as 1000 ms, and Timeout (ms) as 500 ms, 10 pings are sent and the interval between each ping is set to 1000 ms. A successful test requires all 10 pings to be received within 500 ms each. The ping test continues even if the device user leaves the screen, but they can stop it at any time by tapping the stop button. Otherwise, the test automatically stops once the set conditions are met. A notification is also displayed in the notification bar for the duration of the test, which the user can tap to return to the test screen. #Battery When the device user selects Battery from the Diagnostics menu, the Status and History tabs are shown at the bottom of the screen. ##Status The Status tab provides information on the following battery-related data points: Battery status - Indicates whether the device is connected to a charger or not. Battery level, State of health - The overall health of the device's battery, defined as Good, Normal, or Bad. Battery voltage, Charger type, Charger plug, Battery's rated capacity, Battery health - The percentage of the battery's original charge it can currently hold.

For example, this November 17, 2021 release - what would have been Knox cloud service 1.41 - uses 21.11 as the version name. End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), solutions on the Knox cloud service are no longer supported on Internet Explorer. The Knox cloud service is best accessed on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Expanded device support Knox Asset Intelligence previously only supported Samsung rugged devices running Knox 3.7.1, including the Galaxy XCover Pro and Galaxy Tab Active3. With this release, Galaxy S21 devices running Knox 3.8 are now supported. For a comprehensive list of supported devices, see Devices Secured by Knox. Today's Device Issue Report With 21.11, a new TODAY'S DEVICE ISSUE REPORT widget is added to the Knox Asset Intelligence dashboard. Located below the TOTAL DEVICES widget, the device issue report highlights any issues that occurred during the day. IT admins can configure email alerts to be sent if the number of daily events exceeds certain percentage thresholds. On-device diagnostics from the Knox Asset Intelligence agent app In 21.11, device users can generate and send debug logs directly from their devices to the Knox Asset Intelligence console. IT admins can view these debug logs in-console, along with an error category and description. The logs can then be attached to a Knox Support ticket to aid in the troubleshooting process. For more information, see Use the Knox Asset Intelligence app. New SSID filter for abnormal Wi-Fi disconnection events This release adds a feature to let you upload an SSID list from the Wi-Fi connectivity screen, allowing you to filter abnormal Wi-Fi disconnection events by SSID. Additionally, events are now broadcast to the server every time they occur instead of after a set time interval. You can upload a list of SSIDs to the admin console and use them to filter device data. For example, you might want to view scanning data from devices connected to a specific Wi-Fi network. Refer to Wi-Fi connectivity to learn more. New scanning performance charts and data points In 21.11, additional data points and charts are available for the scanning performance module. The new data points are as follows: UNUSED DEVICES - Records any devices without reported scan activity over the configured time period. CAMERA VS HARDWARE SCAN - Shows the number of scans performed by device cameras compared to those performed by hardware scanners. See Scanning performance for more details. Improved data in abnormal Wi-Fi disconnection CSV exports Previously, when exporting abnormal Wi-Fi disconnection events as a CSV file, devices were grouped by unique events with the total number listed in the Device count column. Now, Wi-Fi disconnection events are separated by device and identified with the corresponding device ID. SSID information is also included for each event entry. The updated CSV columns are as follows, with new columns in bold: Event, Device ID, AP vendo, 11 reason, AP type, SSID, BSSID, Bands, Power saving mode of device, Device screen state Improved data in App no response/force close CSV exports Previously, when exporting data from the App no response and Force close modules as a CSV file, only information on the event class, number of event occurrences, and impacted devices was included. Now, the device ID, app version, OS version, event class, call stack, and time are included in the CSV export. The call stack contains the detailed reason for the event, and assists IT admins in troubleshooting the cause of the event. Consolidated app package names Prior to Knox Asset Intelligence 21.11, some app package names appeared multiple times in different languages on the admin console. With the 21.11 release, Knox Asset Intelligence consolidates all data associated with the duplicate app packages under the English name, allowing IT admins to identify usage metrics quickly and accurately. Updated logic for battery state of health measurements Starting from 21.11, the Measuring state is no longer available when Knox Asset Intelligence gathers battery state of health information from a device. The Measuring state and the corresponding data collected from the last 5 charging cycles were originally designed to provide greater data accuracy, but the logic was improved so accurate battery state of health information can be captured without using 500% of the device's battery first. Improved search functionality for app insight pages Now, you can search for package names in addition to app names. The search feature also supports partial package names. For example, searching com.samsung displays results for all packages containing com.samsung. Back to Release notes",

            "content": "Knox Asset Intelligence 22.03 release notes. This important Knox Asset Intelligence release introduces several new features and improvements, including device groups, app usage enhancements, and further integration with the Knox Admin Portal. You must update your Knox Asset Intelligence agent to the latest version for some of the following features and updates to apply. Device grouping feature For organizations managing a large number of devices across several locations, Knox Asset Intelligence now offers a device grouping feature, which helps you focus on devices assigned to a particular location. The Devices menu also includes a new GROUPS tab, where you can view and manage your device groups. Admins can be assigned to certain groups, who can then receive email alerts for those groups. Currently, there are two ways to group devices: Using existing group IDs from an EMM, Uploading a CSV file that contains device IDs and device group names On the dashboard, you can search for a device group to filter data by that group. Both EMM groups and groups uploaded through a CSV file are supported. See Manage devices for more information about device groups. Managed app lists Knox Asset Intelligence 22.03 adds an option for you to create managed app lists to filter which apps you want to see insights from, allowing you to focus on business apps and hide unwanted insights from others. Once you apply a managed app list, the APP USAGE, APP NO RESPONSE, FORCE CLOSE, and ABNORMAL EVENTS dashboard modules can be filtered to only show data from apps in the list. You can do so by selecting Managed in the Apps dropdown. If needed, you can also switch between filters to see insights from unmanaged apps. See Managed apps to learn more. Improvements to app usage insights Previously, the app usage chart showed the average running time of apps on devices, causing apps with low installation rates but unexpectedly high usage to be overrepresented and appear on top. Exporting app-specific usage data also generated a CSV file that only contained data about the average run time and battery usage. The app usage chart now shows total app run time across the devices. This change allows for a more representative view of which apps are frequently used. The CSV export process is also updated to match the new data points. Depending on the export method, the table data contains more granular insights, such as specific app usage info for a device or the battery percentage consumed daily by each impacted device. You can export the data through the ACTIONS menu, or by hovering over a device group and clicking the download link in the app usage chart. Learn more about the app usage changes at Application usage. Issue report dashboard settings Starting with this release, Knox Asset Intelligence can send an email alert once a certain percentage of devices report app or Wi-Fi-related events. You can customize the minimum size of the device group and the thresholds at which alerts are triggered. For example, say you manage a group of 100 devices. The yellow alert threshold for abnormal app events could be set to 15% and the red alert threshold set to 25%. You would then receive an email alert when 16 devices report an abnormal app event, and another when 26 devices report an event. You can also manage your report preferences through the new Reporting menu in Manage services & preferences on the Knox Admin Portal, including recipients in the mailing list. From the menu, you can choose whether to receive reports for app-related issues, Wi-Fi-related issues, or both. Updates to device enrollment flow For company-owned devices with a work profile, Android 12 introduced new policies that require the device users to manually grant location permissions. To encourage smooth device onboarding, the Knox Asset Intelligence enrollment flow is updated in this release. Call permissions and location permissions are no longer required to complete enrollment, and location permissions can be optionally granted afterwards. After a company-owned device is enrolled with a work profile, the device user is now prompted to grant location permissions through the notification bar on the device. Tapping the notification prompts them to choose whether to allow or deny the location permission. If the device user declines, Wi-Fi and location data can't be collected on the device. On the updated Devices page, you can filter by devices that were not granted location permissions and remotely send the user a notification to grant the device location permissions. See Enroll devices for the full workflow. Device status improvements Previously, active devices counted toward the total enrolled device count. However, when a device became inactive, it was removed from the Enrolled count and added to Inactive instead. Now, the device status logic is improved to include a new Active status. The number of enrolled devices is the sum of both inactive and active devices. The device statuses are now as follows: Enrolled - All devices enrolled in Knox Asset Intelligence that have consumed a license seat. Active - Devices actively communicating with the server. Inactive - Devices which are enrolled, but haven't communicated with the Knox server for 7 consecutive days. In the device status block on your dashboard, click the Enrolled tile to move to a list of active and inactive devices. Improvements to enrollment failure reasons Previously, upon enrollment failure devices were categorized as Not enrolled without a descriptive cause for the failure. Now, Knox Asset Intelligence delivers an error reason and applies a Failed to enroll status. To view the reason, click View device log in the device details panel. This new error message is intended to assist you when troubleshooting enrollment failures. Consolidated device info view Along with all other Knox cloud services, Knox Asset Intelligence now supports a unified device view in the Knox Admin Portal. If a device is enrolled in multiple Knox cloud services, enter its IMEI/MEID in the top search bar to view info about it across all the services it's enrolled in. You can also access this device view from the Devices page. To do so, click on a device. Then, in the device details panel, click View unified device info to go to the Device information page on the Knox Admin Portal. Integrated administrators and roles menu Previously, you could only manage Knox Asset Intelligence admins and roles from the service's console. While the current admin menu on the Knox Asset Intelligence console remains the same, the 22.03 release introduces a new Administrators & Roles page in the left navigation bar. This page allows super admins to view, invite, and manage secondary admins for all Knox cloud services that your organization uses, including Knox Asset Intelligence. Back to Release notes",

            "content": "Knox Asset Intelligence 22.06 release notes. This Knox Asset Intelligence release contains several major improvements, including a dashboard redesign, support for work shifts, additions to reported device data, and an updated enrollment process. The described changes in this release are organized into the following categories: UX improvements, Reported device data, Enrollment, Other UX improvements #Dashboard redesign The Knox Asset Intelligence dashboard has been redesigned to help you access relevant device insights more quickly. Under Dashboard in the navigation pane, individual module pages now separate network, app, and battery insights to complement the main dashboard. To support the new design, the dashboard settings now feature more granular configuration options for your dashboard. For example, you can choose to only see foreground app usage in the Application usage module instead of both foreground and background app usage. You can also select which widgets appear on the main dashboard, and drag and drop them to change their order. Information is displayed based on the device's system time. To learn more, refer to Configure your dashboard. #Consolidated Licenses menu Previously, the Knox Asset Intelligence console had a dedicated License menu to manage Knox Asset Intelligence licenses. Now, the License menus in each Knox cloud service lead to a consolidated Licenses menu on the Knox Admin Portal. While the existing functionality remains unchanged, the new menu is designed to help you easily manage licenses across multiple services. For more info, see Manage Knox licenses in the Knox Admin Portal guide. #Event threshold additions Previously, IT admins could only configure event thresholds for TODAY'S ISSUES, which included thresholds for the percentage of devices affected. The event thresholds are now expanded to include Wi-Fi disconnection and battery events. You can now see Wi-Fi disconnection events by BSSIDs, groups, and devices above a certain number of events, and set the battery consumption percentage to trigger a battery drain event or low battery event once exceeded. Event thresholds apply to the whole Knox Asset Intelligence tenant. All other users in your tenant are able to see and receive alerts for those thresholds. See Thresholds for more details. #Support for work shift configurations You can now set work shift policies in the dashboard settings. Work shifts can be defined by a set time range based on the device's system time, or by detecting Wi-Fi connection events to allowlisted SSIDs. For more details, see Work shifts. Reported device data #Enhancements to Wi-Fi disconnection insights With the 22.05 release, you can now see groups and BSSIDs that reported the highest number of Wi-Fi disconnection events. This change helps you more easily identify which groups are most seriously impacted by Wi-Fi disconnection events, and diagnose network issues for impacted BSSIDs. To support this change, the dashboard widget has been redesigned, and an additional widget is now available to show disconnection events by BSSID. For recurring disconnection events that make up more than 10% of all reported events for that time period, you can also export an event log with detailed info about each disconnection event. See Wi-Fi connectivity for more details. #Enhancements to battery insights In this release, new data points to check battery levels at the start and end of each work shift are included along with critical battery drain events. The percentage threshold for low battery and critical drain events can be configured in the dashboard settings. Additionally, miniature insight charts are now available. These charts provide an at-a-glance view of various battery events, and can be added to your dashboard. These insights are intended to help you understand whether device batteries last through a full work shift, or if the devices are due for a replacement. Click to download a CSV file with the full list of event-related data. To learn more, refer to the following pages: Battery status, Battery state of health #Enhancements to app insights Similar to the battery insight modules, miniature insight charts are now available, along with new charts on Wi-Fi and mobile network usage per app. Use these charts to quickly identify and address apps that are impacting business continuity. Click a chart to show a detailed view, which features an expanded chart and more granular info about the apps and affected devices. Refer to the following pages for more details: Application usage, App no response, Force close, Abnormal app events Enrollment #Improvements to enrollment experience Previously, the Knox Asset Intelligence enrollment process varied depending on whether the agent was launched manually or automatically after installation. If the device user manually launched the agent, location permissions were required for enrollment to begin. However, an automatic launch didn't require the same location permissions to start enrollment. Starting with 22.05, a standardized enrollment experience is provided so that enrollment can start immediately even if location permissions aren't granted on the device. If your EMM has an option to automatically launch apps after installation, enrollment can also be triggered this way. In the event the device doesn't have location permissions after enrollment, a notification asks the device user to grant the proper permissions. If the agent is launched on the device by either an EMM or device user and enrollment fails, a notification is shown. The user can tap Retry in the notification to directly attempt enrollment again. #Support for out-of-box experience To enhance the enrollment process, out-of-box experience (OOBE) is now available to automatically deploy Knox Asset Intelligence to devices without requiring user interaction. OOBE can only be used for reseller-uploaded devices that have been approved by the enterprise in the Knox Asset Intelligence console. Any devices uploaded in bulk through a CSV file can't be enrolled using OOBE. To learn more, see Enroll with OOBE. Other #Option to hide service running notification on device Previously, devices enrolled in Knox Asset Intelligence always displayed a running notification in the notification bar. Now, you can hide the running notification from the device's settings. To do so, go to Apps > Knox Asset Intelligence > Notifications > Notification Category, and turn on Foreground service channel.

            "content": "Knox Asset Intelligence 22.08 release notes. This Knox Asset Intelligence release contains several improvements, including upgrades to the agent, new dashboard charts, and custom admin roles. Device diagnostics In this release, a new Diagnostics menu is available in the Knox Asset Intelligence agent. After tapping Diagnostics, device users can select Wi-Fi to send certain commands and test for IP/DNS server network latency issues. They can also select Battery to view a comprehensive list of battery information, such as its state of health and charging status. To streamline the troubleshooting process, device users can send error reports from either of the menu categories. See Use the agent app to learn more. Improvements to agent Device status menu Previously, the Knox Asset Intelligence agent featured a Device status menu that displayed device, battery, and Wi-Fi information. With the introduction of device diagnostics in this release, the Device status menu is reworked to show only device information. Additional data points, such as the Android security patch level, screen display resolution, display density in DPI, the Wi-Fi MAC address, and the Bluetooth address are also available. New dashboard charts The following section describes four new available on the Knox Asset Intelligence dashboard. #Groups with app issue events Groups with app issue events lists the 5 groups with the highest number of reported app issues, the number of impacted apps associated with those issues, and the number of unique impacted devices. Refer to App issues for more details. #Groups with low battery events Groups with low battery events shows the 5 groups reporting the highest numbers of unique devices and low battery events. To learn more, see General battery charts. #Groups with low battery devices at shift start Groups with low battery devices at shift start helps you identify which devices weren't sufficiently charged before the start of a shift. This chart displays the 5 groups with the highest number of devices with a battery level lower than the set threshold at the start of a work shift. To learn more, see General battery charts. #Knox Service Plugin status To aid in troubleshooting enrollment issues, this release adds a dashboard chart to provide visibility into the deployment status of your Knox Service Plugin (KSP) policies. The dashboard lets you see how many of your devices have KSP installed, which profiles were successfully applied, and which profiles failed to apply. The expanded view displays several valuable data points like the KSP app version, profile name, whether the profile policies were successfully applied, and a link to view or download the full policy schema file sent to the device. If the policies were not successfully applied or were only partially applied, you can also view or download a policy report to help you troubleshoot further. By default, the KSP status chart is disabled on your dashboard. You can enable it in the dashboard settings. See Knox Service Plugin status for more information. Improvements to custom admin roles Previously, Knox Asset Intelligence admins could only have pre-defined roles. Each role had fixed permissions, and super admins could not edit them at a granular level. Starting from 22.08, custom roles and permissions are now supported. Admins with the Manage roles permission can create and edit roles, and select which permissions those roles have. Admins with the Manage roles permission can give any permission to any admin, regardless of whether they have that permission or not. Refer to Invite and manage admins for more details. Auto-OOBE enrollment Prior to the 22.08 release, devices enrolling in Knox Asset Intelligence through out-of-box experience (OOBE) automatically started enrollment once its reseller upload was approved by an admin. Now, a new option to automatically enroll reseller-uploaded devices is available in the console. This option, available in the Resellers and Devices menus or when you approve a single upload from a reseller, must be selected for enrollment to start automatically during OOBE. For more information, see Enroll devices. Improvements to event thresholds The following section outlines a number of additions and improvements made to the Dashboard settings in the 22.08 release. #Recommended thresholds The NETWORK and BATTERY thresholds now feature a Recommended network threshold option. The thresholds are calculated based on an internal statistical model. This option is only available once Knox Asset Intelligence has collected enough network and battery data from your devices. If you enable the recommended values and save your changes, the existing threshold values are overridden for all admins in your tenant. #App thresholds A new APP category is available, which lets you define what high battery consumption and high network usage events are on your devices. If an app consumes more than the defined battery amount on a device per day, a battery consumption event is logged. Similarly, if an app consumes more than the defined Wi-Fi and mobile data amount on a device per day, a high network usage event is logged and shown in the relevant dashboard charts. #Battery thresholds Additionally, a Low battery at shift start threshold is available under TODAY'S ISSUES. You can also define thresholds for battery state of health, low battery events, battery drain events, and charge events under BATTERY. An insight appears on the relevant dashboard chart once the number of reported events exceeds the set threshold. To support these changes, the email preferences menu now includes an option to send email alerts for battery-related issues. Improvements to work shifts Knox Asset Intelligence can now calculate work shifts by checking for managed app usage in the foreground every 10 minutes. A work shift starts when a designated managed app is launched, and the shift ends after 2 hours elapse without any reported foreground usage from the app. Back to Release notes",

            "content": "Knox Asset Intelligence 22.11 release notes. Mobile network usage dashboard chart The Knox Asset Intelligence 22.11 release introduces a new Mobile network usage dashboard chart, which displays cellular signal information arranged by carrier network and SIM. This chart provides insight into which network generations are used per carrier. The five carriers with the longest cumulative connection durations are shown, along with the number of devices associated with each. The information also includes the type of cellular network, the connection duration, and the cellular usage by carrier, enabling you to diagnose mobile network connectivity issues and avoid impacts to performance. Additional drill down views for battery events Starting with the 22.11 release, you can view new drill down pages for low battery, battery charging, and battery drain events. These drill down pages let you identify which devices were impacted over a certain time period, so that you can troubleshoot battery issues for them. See General battery charts for more details. Expanded views for each app usage dashboard chart Prior to the 22.11 release, clicking > in the following dashboard charts took you to the same App usage expanded view: Total app usage, Background app usage, Foreground app usage, Apps with highest network usage, Apps with highest battery consumption Starting with this release, clicking > on each app usage dashboard chart takes you to a unique expanded view with additional information related to that dashboard chart. For more information, refer to App usage. Minimum device count data filter for app usage Before 22.11, small quantities of devices could report high usage statistics that weren't representative of the entire device fleet. For example, if only one device logged a comparatively high amount of YouTube usage, the Apps with highest battery consumption chart showed the YouTube app as one of the top five apps consuming the most amount of battery. This release adds a minimum device count option to the thresholds defined in the dashboard settings, which filters out outliers in charts. See Configure your dashboard to learn more. Support for secondary IMEIs on dual-SIM devices Previously, Knox Asset Intelligence wouldn't report the secondary IMEI (IMEI2) of dual-SIM devices. Device search, device lists, and device detail pages on the console, as well as exported reports now support queries for a device's secondary IMEI. If a dual-SIM device returns only one IMEI, the IMEI is denoted by either IMEI1 or IMEI2, depending on which SIM slot the card occupies on the device. This feature will be rolled out in phases. In 22.11, only the Devices page shows secondary IMEI information. The other pages, such as Network, App and Battery, will support secondary IMEIs starting with 23.03. Disable auto-enrollment feature Prior to the 22.11 release, you could choose to automatically enroll all devices uploaded by a reseller, but there was no way to revoke auto-enrollment for specific devices. Additionally, auto-enrollment was only available for devices when their status was Not enrolled. Auto-enrollment can now be disabled for specific devices. Auto-enrollment is also now supported for devices with all statuses except for Pending. For more details, refer to Enroll devices. Improvements to dashboard settings With this release, the Dashboard settings page is renamed to Settings and the feature descriptions under DATA UPLOAD are simplified. See Configure your dashboard to learn more. App diagnostics in the Knox Asset Intelligence agent Extending the diagnostics features introduced in 22.08, this release adds app diagnostics to the Knox Asset Intelligence agent. After selecting Diagnostics on the main screen, the device user selects App to see the following three categories of app issues: Application not responding, Force close, Abnormal event They then choose a category to see a list of apps that reported that issue type over the last 24 hours. They can also send a debug log file by tapping Error report. Refer to Use the agent app for more details. Enhancements to battery state of health With the 22.11 release, battery state of health information for certain device models with replaceable batteries is enhanced with data trained with a machine learning model. Only certain device models are supported for the initial release. For more information, see Battery state of health. Improvements to license replacement logic Previously, when replacing a license for Knox Asset Intelligence, the new license required more total assignments than the number of activations on the license being replaced. Now, a license can be replaced regardless of the assignments available on the new license. If more devices are selected for replacement than new assignments are available, the extra devices remain on the original license. Back to Release notes",

Update to supported Android versions In accordance with our updated Android support plan, the minimum supported version for Android devices registered in Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Configure, and Knox Deployment app have each rolled forward. To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Simplified registration for and access to Knox cloud services The registration and access flows for Knox cloud services are streamlined. The My Knox dashboard is retired, and you can now sign in to the Knox Admin Portal directly and manage your Knox services, including Knox Asset Intelligence. After you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you can operate Knox Asset Intelligence right away. If you'd like to display or register for additional Knox services, click your account icon > Settings > Show/hide services. Individual Knox Asset Intelligence licenses You can now purchase Knox Asset Intelligence license keys independent of Knox Suite. The individual and Knox Suite offerings are identical, with no feature or console differences between the two. If you purchase an individual Knox Asset Intelligence license, you can upgrade to a Knox Suite license at any time. Conversely, you have the option to replace a Knox Suite license with an individual license. To upgrade or downgrade a license, you can replace it in Licenses. Support for managed service providers in the Knox MSP Program The 23.03 release adds support for managed service providers in the Knox MSP Program, enabling them to manage Knox Asset Intelligence services for customers. MSP admins aren't able to manage location-related features. Additionally, Knox Asset Intelligence allows you to send issue reports for device groups to specific admins, but MSP admins can't be added to this admin list due to a current limitation. Instead, MSP admins can receive issue reports for all device groups by adding their email address in Email preferences. Additional support for secondary IMEIs on dual-SIM devices In the 22.11 release, secondary IMEI support for device search, device lists, device detail pages on the console, and exported reports was added. Now, Knox Asset Intelligence supports secondary IMEIs for app, battery, and scanning-related dashboard charts. CSV file exports also include secondary IMEI information. Enhancements to battery charging event data The 23.03 release adds the following data points related to charging events, which are now included in CSV exports: Device battery level, Time remaining until a device is fully charged, Battery voltage Additionally, devices running Android 13 and higher can now report pogo pin chargers as a charger plug type. Updates to app usage data on the dashboard Previously, to avoid showing unnecessarily high numbers of apps on the Knox Asset Intelligence dashboard, any usage data from apps that reported less than 0.1% average battery usage was filtered out. With the 23.03 release, this filtering policy is removed. All app usage data is now shown on the dashboard regardless of average battery consumption. If you only want to see data from certain apps, you can set a list of managed apps in your dashboard settings to filter out unwanted insights. Tcpdump log support Device users can now send you tcpdump logs from devices running Android 12 and higher to help with advanced troubleshooting of network issues between the device and server. This feature is available in the Error Reports section of the agent. To generate a tcpdump log, device users first need to acknowledge that sensitive information might be uploaded to the server, then reproduce the issue while the Knox Asset Intelligence agent is capturing packet information. For more information, see Send a tcpdump log. Device data collection toggle Previously, Knox Asset Intelligence collected app runtime and network usage data by default. Now, admins with the Manage dashboard permission can now turn off device data collection for all available data points, including app runtime and network usage data. Refer to Configure your dashboard for more details. Support for User Acceptance Testing Starting with the 23.03 release, upcoming Knox Asset Intelligence features and changes can be trialed in the User Acceptance Testing environment two weeks before their planned release date. The 23.03 User Acceptance Testing period starts on March 8th, 2023. Since Knox Asset Intelligence supports analytics for historical data - for example, the past 7 ,14, 30, or 60 days - you'll only see data on the dashboard after the selected period has passed. To take full advantage of UAT's testing capabilities, we recommend you keep your devices enrolled in UAT to maintain device data history. Additionally, recommended threshold values aren't supported for UAT. As recommended threshold values are calculated based on collected device data, the 10-seat UAT license won't generate enough data to support this feature. See the UAT guide to learn more about the UAT environment. Battery charging event history in the agent To help you identify when your devices might be encountering charging issues, the Knox Asset Intelligence agent now displays historical battery charging data in Diagnostics > Battery. This charging history spans the last 14 days, and includes insights like in and out amperage, battery charge, and battery voltage. Device drop detection (beta) Knox Asset Intelligence 23.03 introduces a beta release of drop detection. Track which devices are dropped most often, as well as how many times a device is typically dropped before it requires repairs. This feature is intended to help you identify which device models you may want to consider putting protective cases on, or if a device may need to be replaced soon. Currently, drop detection is supported for certain device models. You can turn drop detection on in your dashboard settings. Device drop detection is currently in beta. If you enable this option in your dashboard settings, device drop data is collected but won't be visible on your dashboard yet. You'll be able to see related insights on your dashboard in the future.

The 23.09 release of Knox Asset Intelligence introduces the following changes: New dashboard tile for app screen time A new Screen time dashboard tile lets you see how many hours an app was used in the foreground, and how many times it was launched by a device user, regardless of the device's charging state. Extended call stack support for Apps Not Responding and Forced Closed events Several improvements were made to the Apps with issue events insight. Previously, when viewing call stack data for Apps Not Responding (ANR) and Force Close (FC) events, it was possible that some data wasn't available due to the CSV file size limit. This release increases the file size limit, letting you see the full call stack for both event types. For the ANR (App Not Responding) events, you can now download the full call stack as TXT file from the console. For the FC (Force close) events, you can now view the extended call stack in a popup on the console. To learn more about viewing call stack data, see App issues. New dashboard tiles for Knox Service Plugin profile failures Two new tiles related to Knox Service Plugin are available. You can now see which Knox Service Plugin policies caused a profile failure, and how many profile failures occurred per error category. New CSV download option for Network latency trend data You can now download a CSV file of your Network latency trend data. In the Network latency response times tile's expanded view, a new ACTIONS menu in the RESPONSE TIME PER GROUP data table contains two options for downloading a CSV file: To download the CSV data for groups in the fleet, select one or more groups from the list, then click ACTIONS > Download as CSV. You can also perform this action without selecting a group. If no group is selected, the CSV file will contain data for all groups. To download the CSV data for devices in a specific group, select one or more groups from the list, the click ACTIONS > Download device list as CSV. If you select more than one group, the CSV file will contain data for all devices in the selected groups. To learn more about the CSV file and what type of data is available, see the Network latency page. Ability to refresh Device logs When viewing a device log, you can now refresh the page to get the latest data, without needing to close and re-open the page. Mobile network diagnostics in agent app The Knox Asset Intelligence agent app now lets device users view mobile network diagnostic information like total data consumption for each SIM card in their device, and network signal strength. New dashboard tile for device security vulnerabilities A new Labs dashboard tile called the Security Center lets you track vulnerabilities across different Samsung device models in your fleet. It provides the ability to know which individual devices are at risk from a particular vulnerability, and which are covered by the latest security patch. Additionally, with Knox Attestation, the Security center dashboard tile provides insight into whether your devices have ever installed non-official Samsung software. The Fleet integrity chart in the tile's expanded view shows you how many devices have a Good, Bad, or Unknown status. Devices that have failed Knox Attestation receive a Bad status. New dashboard tile for device drop detection (Labs) A new Labs dashboard tile called Device drop detection lets you see how many times your devices were dropped, and the height from which they were dropped. This feature currently only reports drop events between 0.9m and 1.8m. Back to Release notes",

The devices were uploaded by a reseller. 2. The devices were approved by an admin in the Knox Asset intelligence console. Starting with 22.08, you must also enable the auto-enrollment feature in order for devices to automatically enroll. How do I automatically enroll devices in Knox Asset Intelligence through OOBE or after a factory reset? See Auto-enrollment for detailed steps on how to enable the auto-enrollment feature for your devices. You can only change the auto-enrollment status for devices with the Not enrolled status. If you want to set a currently enrolled device to automatically enroll after a factory reset, unenroll it through the Devices tab. After its license is revoked and the device status changes to Not enrolled, enable the auto-enrollment feature. Then, factory reset the device.",

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

            "content": "About single sign-on. Simplify user access management by setting up single sign-on (SSO) for use with Samsung Knox services. As a super admin, you can reduce the administrative burden on your IT department by managing all users through your identity management portal. Users can authenticate with just one set of credentials to quickly access Knox services. Note that once SSO is set up for your Samsung Knox tenant, any sub-admins that you invite can only use their SSO credentials to sign in. The Samsung account and SSO sign-in methods cannot be used together. Supported services Currently, customers can set up SSO to sign in to the following Knox services: Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Manage, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Partner Program (Knox Deployment Program, Knox MSP Program) If your Knox account is subscribed to a Knox service other than those listed above, the SSO settings are disabled for your account. Supported account types Currently, SSO authentication is supported for Microsoft Azure AD, Ping Identity, and Okta accounts. For Microsoft Azure AD integrations, all users signing in to Samsung Knox must be associated with: A licensed Office 365 mailbox, A shared Office 365 mailbox If you're signing in with a shared mailbox, make sure credentials are enabled for the mailbox. Any accounts associated with distribution groups must first be converted to a licensed user or shared mailbox. Distribution accounts cannot be used to access the Knox Admin Portal once SSO is set up for your organization. A user's Samsung account email address must also match the email address they signed up for the Knox Admin Portal with, otherwise they are blocked from accessing Knox services. To change a Samsung account to match the Knox account, see: How can I change my email address registered in the Samsung Knox system?, How to change a super admin in Samsung Knox Cloud Services Before you begin To start configuring SSO settings, you first need to register for a Samsung Knox account.

For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise. For more information on DualDAR and its unique design, see the DualDAR architecture page.",

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "title": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

            "content": "Trusted Boot. Trusted Boot is a Knox Platform feature representative of Samsung's industry leading mobile device boot protection. Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

            "content": "Device Software Update Management. Frequent software updates are often necessary to resolve bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and enhance device capabilities. But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general. This restriction includes updates for firmware, security patches, bug fixes, and apps. Disable USB-connected updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from booting into Download Mode and installing a manual software update. This restriction includes updates through the Odin, Kies, and Smart Switch update tools.",

With the Knox\"Platform, you can deploy firewall configurations specifically catered to your enterprise security needs. Why manage and customize device firewalls? Default firewalls may not provide your organization with the security and data protection it needs. In fact, some firewalls may not even let you see the rules they are enforcing. However, when configuring firewalls with the Samsung Knox Platform, you can know exactly what policies are deployed and take additional measures to secure your enterprise systems. With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain. Per-app and device-wide modes - Give specific apps - for example, ones that handle confidential data - stronger firewalls, and all other apps on a device a more lenient firewall configuration. Log unsafe URL access The Knox Platform provides visibility into denied attempts to access blocked domains. The improved visibility helps you to remain aware of potential security breaches or insecure browsing practices within your organization. The Knox Platform logs reports with the following information: App name - The package name of the app attempting to access a blocked domain. Blocked domain URL - The URL of the domain name blocked by your firewall. Timestamp - The time the incident occurred, to assist with troubleshooting incidents.",

The Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated, from partner feedback and industry data, to solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider. The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

This page lists the firewall exceptions that your organization needs to use to securely reach and connect to the Knox server and its supporting resources. It includes the URLs and port numbers that you need to allowlist in order to reach the Knox servers. These server resources can include the following Knox services: _Samsung license Servers_ - When you activate Knox services, devices need to verify their license keys. Devices periodically check their licenses a few times a week. _Samsung SDS IAM & EMM_ - If you're using an EMM, devices will need to access web-based EMM consoles and storage sites. _Samsung ActiveSync Server_ - If you're using Exchange ActiveSync, you'll need an ActiveSync Server connection so the email client can successfully reach the ActiveSync Server. If your organization doesn't permit connections with external servers, you can request an on-premises Knox Server to handle license verification within your firewall. Samsung charges an extra fee for this service. For more information, contact your Samsung representative or reseller. Ports 443 and 80 must be open within your local network domain to reach Knox server resources. Knox Cloud Services can utilize both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Firebase. Both services may also warrant adding to the allowlist within your organization's firewall policy. For information on the AWS that may require allowlist inclusion, see https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to. Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account. Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service. Once you're finished editing, click SAVE to record your changes. Alternatively, you can choose to delete the role. Click DELETE at the bottom of the page to remove the role from the list and remove the associated permissions for all admins who are assigned to the role. Note that this action can't be undone.",

Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

For more information, refer to the Knox Guard admin guide. Device deletion from all Knox cloud services Prior to 22.11, if a device needed to be removed from all subscribed Knox services, it had to be deleted from each service individually. Now, admins with the Manage devices and Delete permissions and access to all Knox cloud services can delete a device on the centralized device information page after searching for it. Enhancements to Knox Manage admin management The 22.11 release adds the ability for Knox Admin Portal admins to resend and revoke invitations for new Knox Manage admins in your tenant, as well as deactivate and reactivate current Knox Manage admins, on the consolidated Administrators & Roles page.

To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Updates to Samsung Knox and Knox Admin Portal enrollment The My Knox dashboard is now deprecated, and the Samsung Knox and Knox Admin Portal enrollment flows are streamlined to reduce the barrier of entry and provide a cohesive user experience. When a new user signs into their Knox account for the first time, they're greeted with a welcome screen and can select services they want to see and use in the Knox Admin Portal. This new onboarding flow also replaces the Knox Admin Portal auto-tour. Knox Admin Portal homepage After you sign in to Samsung Knox, you are now greeted by a new homepage that contains guidance about how to get started with Knox services, including links to the latest features and support resources. All tools and resources that were previously found on the My Knox dashboard are also available through this homepage. You can set the landing page to be either the new homepage or the dashboard of a Knox service in Settings. To return to the homepage at any time, click Knox Admin Portal in the top-left corner or Home in the navigation pane.

Support for admin deletion To help control privileges and maintain the roster of admins, the 23.06 release introduces the ability to remove admin accounts of your Knox services. Super admins and admins with the Invite and manage administrators permission for all relevant services can now delete other admins, except for super admins, from the Knox Admin Portal. If you have the correct permissions, you can delete an admin by clicking their name in the admin list to edit their details, then clicking MORE ACTIONS > Delete account. This action isn't available if you don't have the correct permissions. Knox Admin Portal access for Knox Guard users In previous releases, due to technical limitations, admins who worked in a tenant that only had Knox Guard as a service couldn't access the Knox Admin Portal. As of the 23.06 release, if Knox Guard is the sole service in your tenant, you can now perform your administrative duties on the Knox Admin Portal. To quickly access the Knox Admin Portal, click Customer portal > Knox Admin Portal on the Knox Guard console. Note that only the following features of the Knox Admin Portal are available for Knox Guard users: The support center , The account details, which include options to: Edit account settings , Show or hide services, where you can also select other Knox services to register for and use on the Knox Admin Portal , Customize the default landing page Knox Remote Support The following release notes describe functionality for Knox Remote Support when accessed through the Knox Admin Portal, and not through the Knox Manage console. #Device list Knox Remote Support now provides a page called Devices, which is a launchpad for starting remote sessions with any device in your enterprise that was both enrolled and configured through an EMM, and currently has the Knox Remote Support agent installed. When you launch Knox Remote Support from the Knox Admin Portal, this page is now the default view. To learn more about the workings and efficiencies offered by the Devices page, see Manage Knox Remote Support devices. #Notification-based and automatic sessions Previously, a support session could only start when the device user opened the Knox Remote Support agent on the device and manually entered an access code that you provided to them. Starting with the 23.06 release, you can initiate a remote session with two new methods available on the Devices page: Ask Users to Start - Sends a push notification to the device with a prompt to start a session, and the device user can tap it to begin. Automatically Start - Immediately starts a support session on the device, without the user's input. This method is only available on Samsung devices that support Knox. Back to release notes",

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

            "content": "About Secured by Knox, Android - Others and Android Go devices. Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments. To leverage the full Knox feature set, consider selecting a device with the Android, Secured by Knox designation instead. Which Knox solutions do Android Go devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Android Enterprise (Generic) Advanced Knox features that are not supported on certain devices While most Samsung devices provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features commonplace in the mobile device market, some devices with lighter hardware specs may not support select advanced features. Please refer to the following articles on related products for the list of such features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Configure How can I enable Kiosk mode on Android, Others/Android Go devices in Knox Manage? To use Kiosk mode, please enroll your device in device owner (DO) mode. Kiosk mode on Android Legacy is not supported. To enroll in DO mode: 1. For devices already in Kiosk mode, perform a factory reset. Then, activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk. 2. For devices that are not yet enrolled, first activate Android Enterprise DO mode before using Kiosk.

Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process.

If your device was previously enrolled using the + gesture, after performing a factory reset on the device, attempting to use the + gesture to enroll the device again results in this error. Resolution If a device has already been enrolled with the + gesture, you do not need to use the gesture to enroll it again as the device already exists in your account. From your KC or KME admin console, you can assign a profile to the device. Once you factory reset the device, the profile is automatically downloaded after the device connects to a network during the setup wizard.

Although the support for the oldest version is no longer available on every first major release in the year, Knox solutions are supported on the latest five major Android versions. With this change, we commit to: 1. Maintain the best-in-class product quality by focusing our resources on the versions that majority of you use. 2. Enhance the security of Knox products by restricting the supported versions to recent ones that have valid security patches from OS or hardware. Exceptions , Knox Platform for Enterprise is supported from Knox 2.4 and each feature is dependent on the specific Knox version. Knox Manage is supported from seven major Android versions (6-12) as of March 2022. To avoid dramatic changes, Knox Manage will take two more years to follow the above policy - targeting to have the same minimum supported version by 2024. Recently released products (i.e. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Capture, etc.) are supported on less than five OS versions now. These products usually have the latest version as minimum supported version when they are launched. Potential impact and risks Devices running older versions of Android won't be unenrolled from Knox services or otherwise interrupted. You may continue to use Knox products on such devices, but the Samsung teams won't provide support for issues on those devices. For security and performance, we recommend upgrading your Android devices to meet the minimum supported version requirements. Supported versions for each Knox solution _Last updated March 22, 2023_ The following table lists the minimum supported Android version for each Knox product.
