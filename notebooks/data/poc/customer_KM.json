To enhance the TCP performance of the SCC client, you must change the registry value. #Set up the TCP communication resource We recommend changing the registry value for the TCP resource in the SCC client for enhanced TCP performance. To change the registry value, complete the following steps: 1. On your computer, open the Registry Editor. 2. Navigate to HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters. 3. Change the value each of the following items. If the value does not exist, right-click anywhere on the screen, and then select New > DWORD (32- bit) Value to create a new one. TcpTimedWaitDelay - Change the default value from 240 (4 minutes) to 30 (30 seconds) to convert the disconnected TCP resource rapidly. For more information, see https://technet.microsoft.com/enus/library/cc938217.aspx. MaxUserPort - Change the default value from 5000 to the maximum value of 65534 to increase the number of concurrent requests delivered to SCC from the application. For more information, see MaxUserPort) in the Microsoft docs. Check the open source license To check the open source license information used in SCC, refer to the following file on the folder where the SCC client is installed: ``` \\scc-client\\resources\\SCCClient-OpenSourceLicense.xml ```",

Samsung Cloud Connector (SCC) creates a secure channel for data transfers from your existing enterprise active directory (AD) and certificate authority (CA) servers. SCC is configured as follows: Component Description Knox Manage serve Knox Manage is hosted in the cloud. The term Knox Manage serve denotes the service's cloud infrastructure. Connector The Knox Manage server has an integrated connector accessible through the Knox Manage console that connects to the enterprise's AD/LDAP and CA servers. In order to join them together, an enterprise must install the SCC client on the AD/LDAP and CA hosts. SCC SCC provides a secure channel between the client's enterprise system and the Knox Manage server. SCC consists of the SCC client, the SCC server, and Control Service Server. The SCC client is installed at the client's site and establishes a secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) channel with the SCC server. The SCC server is installed in the cloud. It sends the requests from the Knox Manage server to the SCC client, and delivers the responses from the SCC client to the Knox Manage server. The SCC Control Service server assigns a port number to be used for AD/LDAP and CA service. LR Switch The L4 switch scales the requests from the SCC client. DB The database (DB) saves the information of the LDAP and CA service of the tenant and the IP/Port information of the SCC server.",

After the update, you can execute the SCC_Setup\\__Version_Builddate_>.exe file again to delete the SCC client. 2. Stop the currently-running SCC client. If the SCC client is running as a batch file, close the SCC Client Services window. If the SCC client is launched as a Windows background service, it automatically terminates and reruns at the time of the update. 3. Decompress the new version of the SCC\\__Region_.zip file. 4. Execute the SCC_Setup\\__Version_Builddate_.exe file. 5. When the upgrade confirmation pop-up appears, click Yes. 6. Click Next when the InstallShield Wizard starts. 7. Click Update.

            "content": "Configure the keepalive settings. You can configure the keepalive settings to check the connection between the Knox Manage server and the device. The Knox Manage server checks the connection between the server and the device at the set interval. The keepalive option helps IT admins to figure out what devices are not connected to the Knox Manage console (for any reason) by trying to establish a connection to the device. If the device is not answering for longer than a set period of time, its status changes to Disconnected. Once the device connects to the Internet again, the Knox Manage agent checks its status, and the Device Status changes to Enrolled. The Keepalive feature is not supported for the following: Staging devices assigned only to groups. Shared iPads. Keepalive notification emails When using a keepalive configuration, you can choose to send a one-time email digest when some of your fleet's devices will expire soon. Here's an example of the email digest: Add a keepalive configuration You can define multiple keepalive configurations at once. Click !add to add a configuration. You can add or edit up to 20 configurations when you save the settings. If a device does not communicate with Knox Manage services for longer then set period of time, its status changes to Disconnected. After the communication is established again, the status changes back to Enrolled. This option is needed to highlight the devices that are not communicating with Knox Manage, so that they are not automatically unenrolled from Knox Manage. To configure the keepalive settings, complete the following steps: 1. Navigate to Setting > Configuration > keepalive. 2. Turn on Keepalive to enable the configurations. 3. Select a target type between Global Setting and Set by Group/Organization. Global Setting - Applies the keepalive settings to all policies. Set by Group or Organization - Applies the keepalive settings to selected groups or organizations. 4. Configure the keepalive settings: Keepalive Expiration (days) - Select a period between 3 and 365 days. If there is no communication between the Knox Manage server and a device for the set period, it attempts to re-establish a connection directly. If the device still fails to establish communication, then its status changes to Disconnected. Lock Device or Work Profile Upon Expiration - If this option is set to Yes, then when the device's keepalive expiration interval - set using a combination of days and hours - elapses without a connection from the device, the device is automatically locked. The device user has to manually unlock the device using the unlock passcode. The IT admin can find this unlock passcode on the Knox Manage console, on the Device Details page > Security tab > Lock device field > unlock passcode. Devices enrolled as Android legacy with Knox Workspace do not support this lock device feature. Keepalive Interval (hours) - Select a cycle to check the connection status by checking the last time the device and the server communicated. Group or Organization - Click Select and select user groups or organizations to apply the keepalive settings. 5. (Optional) Configure automatic keepalive notification emails: Turn on Email for Disconnected Devices. For When to Send Emails (Days before Disconnection), specify when to send the digest. You can schedule the email to be sent on any day leading up to the keepalive duration, minus one. For example, if the keepalive duration is set to 7 days, then the earliest the email could be sent is 6 days before expiration. Click Select to add one or more admins in your tenant as email recipients. If you need to send emails to recipients who aren't attached to accounts in your tenant, click Add and enter their addresses. 6. Click Save.",

            "content": "Add apps using Managed Google Play. The Managed Google Play (MGP) platform provides enterprises with the capability to curate a store of apps intended for use in the work profile or fully managed profile of its managed Android devices. Apps added to an enterprise's MGP can only be installed inside managed profiles on the device, meaning the work profile of a personally-owned device, the main profile of a company-owned device, or the primary profile of a fully managed device. The device user can browse your tenant's MGP store in the Google Play Store app running in the managed profile. You can assign MGP apps to automatically install to the managed profile, or make them available as optional apps that the device user can install as needed. There are three different types of apps on the MGP platform: _Public apps_ are apps sourced from the public Google Play platform. These apps are the same as the apps available to the general public in the Google Play Store app. Some public apps support managed configurations, which are tweakable parameters that the app developer provides for you to customize the app's experience for your device users. _Private apps_ are apps sourced from app packages (APKs) that you upload to the MGP platform for internal use in your enterprise. These apps are only available on your MGP store, and aren't broadcast to the general public. Like public apps, they also support managed configurations. Private apps are meant for enterprises that have enough resources to ensure the availability and continuous versioning of individual APKs. _Web apps_ are apps hosted on web pages. These apps are built, deployed, and run entirely using web technologies rather than lower-level native OS code, but can be made to look and feel like native apps. Ensure that the production versions of apps are available on Managed Google Play for search and download by device users. Beta versions of apps are not supported for search and download on Managed Google Play. As per the limit specified by Managed Google Play, you can upload a maximum of 15 apps per day. Knox Manage doesn't support paid apps on Managed Google Play. Add an app to your MGP store There are three stages in the process of adding an app to your MGP store: 1. Select the platform and app type 2. Enter the app details 3. Configure the app #1. Select the platform and app type First, select the Android platform and app type: 1. On the Knox Manage console, go to Application, then click Add. The Select Application Type dialog opens. 2. For the Platform, select Android. For Type & Source, select Public and Managed Google Play (Store, Private, Web). 3. Click OK. The Google Play console opens inside a dialog. 4. In the Google Play dialog, select an app type: ![Public apps button Search Play Store](#public-app) (public app) , ![Private apps button Private apps](#private-app) , ![Web apps button Web apps](#web-app) #2. Enter the app details Next, add the chosen app type by entering its required details, which vary per type: ##Public app 1. Search for and select an app on the Google Play Store. The app's details open, including the required device access permissions. 2. Click Select to save the app details and proceed. By clicking, you acknowledge that you understand which access permissions the app requires from your fleet's devices. The Google Play dialog closes, and the app configuration page opens. ##Private app 1. Enter a Title for the app as it should appear in your MGP store and the Knox Manage console. The title can differ from the title in the manifest of the APK file. When you first add this APK file, this setting controls the default name of the package, for cases when the app is added to your tenant multiple times under different names and configurations. 2. Click Upload APK and select an APK file from your file system for upload. It may take several minutes to upload the file. Because private apps are APK files that require manual uploadeding and updating, there are several checks in place to ensure compatibility after the upload is complete: An APK must have a unique package name in its manifest. An example package name is com.android.chrome. If your APK has a package name that matches one belonging to another private app in your tenant or on public Google Play, the dialog asks you to re-upload it with a different package name. Renaming the APK file doesn't act as a workaround. The APK must be signed. If you upload an unsigned APK, the dialog asks you to re-upload a signed copy of it. 3. (Optional) Click Make advanced edits to open the Google Play console in a new tab and add a detailed description, screenshots, and other information about the app for display in the MGP store. 4. Click Create to save the app details. The Google Play dialog closes, and the app configuration page opens. ##Web app 1. Enter a Title for the app. The title can differ from the web page title. 2. Enter the URL where the app is hosted. 3. Select a Display for the app, or in other words its layout, while it runs on the device: Full screen - The app's UI occupies the whole screen, like a native app's UI, without any persistent navigation or status bars. Standalone - The navigation and status bars overlay the app. Minimal UI - The navigation, status, and URL bars overlay the app. In effect, the app runs as if it were inside a web browser. 4. Click Create to save the app details. The Google Play dialog closes, and the app configuration page opens. It may take several minutes for the app to sync on the console. #3. Configure the app Lastly, configure the app: 1. Configure the settings for the app: Name - Enter the name for the app as shown on the device. The name doesn't need to match the app's title in MGP. Unassign Option - Select if you want the app to uninstall when it's unassigned from the device. 2. Save the app: Click Save to save the app and return to the app list. Click Save & Assign to save the app and immediately assign the app to groups or organizations. For details on how to assign an app, see Assign Managed Google Play apps. #4. Approve the app From August 17 to September 1, 2022, PDT, Knox Manage will be completing the transition to a newer Google API for device management, and will be unable to automatically approve apps on your behalf on the Google Play console. During this brief transition period, you must manually approve apps on the Google Play console after you add them with Knox Manage. After September 1, the apps will be approved automatically after you add them, as intended. Modify the details of a private app or web app After a private or web app is added to MGP, you might want to modify its details later over the course of business. Any of the app's details you entered while adding it can be modified. In the case of private apps, this includes updating the APK. To modify a private or web app: 1. Click Modify Private & Web. A dialog opens and prompts you to select which type of MGP app you'd like to modify. 2. Select the MGP app type - Managed Google Play Private (private app) or Managed Google Play Web (web app) - then click OK. 3. Select the app. 4. Edit the app's details. For private apps, that can include uploading a new APK, and for web apps, that can include updating the URL. Organize apps MGP grants you to organize apps into categories, which helps the device user sort through the available apps in the managed Google Play Store app on the device. You can add apps to _collections_, which are custom app categories for your tenant. On the front page of the Google Play Store app, the apps are listed by collection. You can only add an app to a collection after it has been added to your MGP store and approved. Between August 17 to September 1, 2022, PDT, you must a manually approve apps on the Google Play console. You can manage app collections and add members to them whenever you add or modify apps through the Google Play dialog on the Knox Manage console. For detailed instructions, see Organize apps into collections in the Managed Google Play Help. See also , Assign Managed Google Play applications",

The Knox Manage agent on Windows has an Application Store page, which the device user can browse for all managed apps. When they select an app, it either installs from the agent, or takes them to the Microsoft Store, where they can install it like a normal app. There are two Windows app types, each with different installation rules: Public apps available through the Windows Store, Internal apps available through the Knox Manage agent Device users can browse public apps on the Knox Manage agent, which redirects them to the Microsoft Store for download. You can configure internal apps to either automatically install to the device, or be made available for download directly from the Knox Manage agent. Knox Manage supports two Windows installer technologies for internal apps: Universal Windows Platform (UWP): Appx or APPXBUNDLE file format , MSIX or MSIXBUNDLE file format, Windows Installer (MSI): MSI file format Chrome OS app support Managed Chrome OS apps are divided between three app sources, each with different methods for adding them: Managed Google Play - Add an app through an iframe of the Google Play console on the Knox Manage console, the same way you add managed apps in Android. Even though both Android and Chrome OS use the same app store, you can't create one app configuration and assign it to both types of devices - you'll need to manage a separate app configuration for each. ID - Add an app or a Chrome browser extension by entering a valid identifier from Google Play or the Chrome Web store. To obtain an identifier, see Get Chrome app or extension IDs. URL - Add an app by entering its URL. Adding a managed Chrome OS app to the Knox Manage console doesn't add it to the Google Admin console.",

App Wrapper (Android) - Reconfigure and save the application so that security policies, such as text copy and screen capture, can be controlled in the console. Unassign Option - Select Uninstall if the app is unassigned, if you want to uninstall the app from the device upon unassigning it. If the Uninstall if the app is unassigned option is selected for an app installed on the device and the app is not assigned to a group or organization in the Knox Manage console, the app is deleted from the device. This applies to all installed apps, whether or not installed through Knox Manage. Managed App Setting (iOS) - Select Yes if you are adding an application that is designed to change the Mobile Device Management (MDM) settings of applications on iOS devices. Key & Value (iOS) - If you selected Yes in Managed App Setting, click Add and enter the key and value of a MDM setting you want to change. You can add one key and its value at a time. Ask the app developers about the key and value for the MDM settings.

Description - Enter a description for the application. Icon - Select the app icon image. Screenshot - Select screenshots of the app to provide a preview for Android device users. 5. Do one of the following: Click Save to save the information and return to the Application list. Click Save & Assign to save this information and proceed to assign the information. Continue on to the next step. 6. Assign the application. For more information, see Assigning internal applications. App wrapping App Wrapper allows you to insert code that controls security policies for internal apps used by customers and then reconfigure the apps, without having to modify the source code. Thus, you can add new functions in a short amount of time, even if you aren't knowledgeable in platform development. Note the following while using the Knox Manage App Wrapper: Conversion using the Knox Manage App Wrapper is limited to internal apps. There may be copyright issues when converting public apps. The security logic app that checks the signing key may not function normally. The functions that you can configure using App Wrapper are screen capture, screen lock, and copy and paste (text only). The existing and wrapped internal apps are distinguished by different icons on the user device. For screen lock, if the Knox Manage agent's screen is locked by the Expiration After (days) and If Password Compliance is Violated policies in the device profile, then the wrapped internal apps are also locked. If you want to use the wrapped internal apps, you need to unlock the screen of the device followed by the screen of the Knox Manage agent.",

After you add a Managed Google Play (MGP) app to your tenant, it must be assigned to groups or organizations for it to become available on devices managed by your tenant. You can have apps installed automatically or become available for the device user to manually install, as needed. In either case, after assignment the app is available on the managed Google Play Store app, either in the personal profile on a fully managed device or in the work profile on a BYOD or mixed-use company-owned device. With a few minor exceptions, all three MGP app types - public, private, web - have the same assignment capabilities with regards to installation and managed configurations options. For Android Enterprise devices, the behavior of some settings varies depending on if the device is managed by the Google EMM API or the Android Management API. Assign an MGP app #Select the app To assign an MGP app to a group or organization, first begin by selecting the app to assign: 1. On the Application page, select one or more apps. If you select more than one app, you can assign them all at once, but you must configure the settings for each app individually. 2. Click Assign. The Assign Application page opens. #Configure the assignment Next, configure the assignment settings: Target Device (public app only) - Select whether to install as an Android Enterprise app, an Android Legacy app, or both. The legacy API offers different installation settings but has limited compatibility. Installation Type (Android Enterprise only) - Select how the app installs on the device: Manual - The device user can choose to manually install the app from the managed Google Play Store app. Automatic (Removable) - The app installs automatically after the profile is deployed, and the device user can uninstall and remove it from the managed Google Play Store app. If the device is managed by the Google EMM API, then the app can't be reinstalled, even by a device command. Automatic (Non-removable) - The app installs automatically, and the device user can uninstall it but not remove it from the managed Google Play Store app. If the device is managed by the Android Management API, then the app can't be uninstalled. Automatic (Non-removable, Android Management API only) - The app installs automatically after the profile is deployed. The device user cannot delete the app after it is installed. Auto-run after Installation - Set to Yes to open the app on the device immediately after installation. If the device is managed by the Android Management API, this setting has no effect. Auto Update Mode - Select an update schedule for the app. The available schedules are: Default Update - The app updates according to the Auto Update Apps setting in your tenant's base Android Enterprise configuration. High Priority - When multiple apps are queued for an update, this app is given precedence in the queue. Postponed (90 days) - When an update is released, it is delayed for 90 days. Managed Configuration (Android Enterprise only) - Click Set Configuration to customize the additional settings for the app in this assignment. These settings don't affect other assignments. By default, each setting is grey, which indicates that it's unset. To apply a setting, click Configure, then select or enter a value. When the setting is configured, the button turns blue. To unset a setting, click \u2713 Configured, which turns the setting and the button grey again. For settings with text fields, click Lookup to browse and select from the list of available lookup items. Lookup items are helpful device- and enterprise-related tokens that substitute their actual values when passed to the device. For example, the $ lookup item substitutes for the device's IMEI/MEID. For detailed information about each of the look up items, see List of lookup items. When configuring Gmail, Outlook, or Samsung Email (6.0 and higher), if you want to pass user account identifiers stored on the Knox Manage server, enter $emailaddress$ in the Email Address field and $username$ in the Username field. If you use Exchange ActiveSync, the email address, account password, and the exchange server name can be entered as lookup items. For more details, see How to configure Exchange ActiveSync. To import a saved configuration for this app, click Import Configuration, then select a CONFIG file from your local filesystem. After importing, the fields populate with the saved configuration's values. Use App Track (private app only) - Set to Use to assign the app to a custom line of development, typically used for early access or pre-release patches. The app track must first be created for your MGP store on the Google Play console. App Track - Select an app track to apply for this assignment. Assign Chrome App (web app only) - Set to Yes to assign the app as a Chrome browser app. By default, the app is assigned to the default web browser on the device. Before you can use this setting, the Chrome app must already be added to your tenant. If you use this setting, any existing Chrome app assignments will be re-applied to devices. Schedule - Specify when the app is automatically installed. Only available if Installation Type is set to Automatic (Removable) or Automatic (Non-removable). Use Deployment Scheduler - You can either choose to allow a scheduled deployment or continue to use manual deployment for the app. Depending upon your requirements, select Use or Do not use. Deployment Starts At - If you've chosen to use a scheduled deployment method, you can select your deployment start time in this option. Use the date picker and time lists to specify the deployment start time. Target - Choose which devices to assign the app to: Target Type - Select whether to assign the app to a Group or an Organization in your tenant.

For more information about VPP availability, see the Apple support site. Confirm that your organization has an Apple Business account. If not, create an account at https://business.apple.com. Verify that your devices are running iOS 7.0 or higher or macOS 10.9 or higher as you can only assign these devices to the VPP. The VPP website http://deploy.apple.com was incorporated into the Apple Business Manager website https://business.apple.com as of December 1, 2019. Upgrade to Apple Business Manager with the guides from the website. The following explanation has important information for using the Apple VPP. Get familiar with it before you start the VPP. Distribution method When you purchase applications through the VPP, you must choose between the following distribution methods for the applications. Managed distribution, Redeemable codes #Managed Distribution Using managed distribution is recommended. The purchased applications are added to Knox Manage when you register a VPP token on the Admin Portal. After assigning the applications, you can unassign and reassign them. Each VPP user receives a license code, which allows them to use the applications after you have assigned them. Upon a change in the application assignment, the application information and total number of license codes are updated automatically. To add purchased applications through managed distribution, the following procedures must be performed. 1. Purchase iOS applications. 2. Download a VPP token from the VPP website 3. Register a download VPP token on the admin portal. 4. Add registered iOS users as VPP users if you want to do user-based app assignment. 5. Add the purchased applications to Knox\"Manage by synchronizing the servers. 6. Assign the applications to devices or VPP users. #Redeemable Codes The selected applications are added to Knox Manage when you upload the spreadsheet containing the redeemable codes for the purchased applications on the Admin Portal. The spreadsheet is downloaded after purchase. Once you assign the applications to VPP users, you cannot unassign or reassign them. To add purchased applications through redeemable codes, the following procedures must be performed. 1. Purchase iOS applications. 2. Download a spreadsheet containing the redeemable codes. 3. Add registered iOS users as VPP users if you want to do user-based app assignment. 4. Upload the spreadsheet. 5. Assign the applications to devices or VPP users. #Status of users The VPP users' statuses are divided into three types: Registered - The user is registered as a VPP user. A VPP invitation has been sent to the user, but the user has not yet accepted the invitation. Associated - The user is registered as a VPP user and has accepted the invitation. The user's device is associated with the user's Apple account. Apple gives the user a VPP Client user ID, which allows them to use the assigned applications. Retired - The user has been removed from the VPP user list on the Admin Portal. The user information is no longer visible in the Admin Portal but remains on the VPP website.",

Typically, aliases give devices meaningful human-readable identifiers in order to better organize your enterprise fleet and recognize particular devices. Device names can't be edited, so if you need an alternative name for a device, use an alias instead. Aliases can vastly improve your enterprise's ability to organize and track devices across various activities and dashboards. They are visible on the Knox Manage console, the Knox Manage agent on the device, the Kiosk app, and iOS and Windows settings. Aliases are a property of Knox Manage, and aren't recognized by other technologies and products. Device aliases are flexible in their usage. You can assign multiple aliases to a device. You can create aliases on a device-by-device or bulk basis. When searching for devices on the Device page, you can find a device by entering any of its aliases. Create a device alias for a single device To create a device alias: 1. On the Knox Manage console, go to Device, then click a device. The Device Details page opens. 2.

IMEI/MEIDs can be registered individually or collectively using an XLS file. You can also register Wi-Fi-only devices with their serial numbers instead of their IMEI/MEIDs. Currently, you cannot register multiple devices using OS version or model name. An employee-owned device with a Work Profile running Android 12 and higher does not share its IMEI/MEID hardware identifier with Knox Manage. Instead, Knox Manage associates it with a unique _enrollment identifier_, which persists across re-deployments. For the purposes of this page, the terms _IMEI/MEID_ and _enrollment identifier_ are interchangeable. Now you can activate limited enrollment for KME devices through the Settings > Android > Limited Enrollment page. When you turn on the KME Devices option, only devices registered through KME can be enrolled. KME devices cannot be enrolled through manual registration or Zero-touch. Android Legacy devices running Android 10 or later only can be controlled by OS version and model name. With IMEI/MEID, the devices can be enrolled even if you don't register their IMEI/MEIDs with Limited Enrollment. Enroll non-KME devices When you select the OR condition, only devices that match one or the other criteria are enrolled.

To delete the work profile from Android Enterprise devices or delete Knox Manage from fully-managed devices, push the Unenroll device command to them. When you unenroll Fully Managed or Fully Managed with Work Profile devices, the devices are factory reset. If the devices are running Android 7 to 8.1, any inserted microSD cards are also wiped. To restart the device user's session, send the Delete account command, and then ask the user to sign in again. Unenroll connected devices To unenroll devices that are connected to the server: 1. Go to Device on the Knox Manage console. 2. On the Device page, select the device you want to unenroll. 3. Click Unenroll. 4. (Optional) Select Unassign profiles and delete devices from KME to delete the device from Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) as well. 5. (Optional) Select Remove Work Profile only to remove installed Knox Manage agents and all management polices from the company-owned device, without unenrolling it. You do not need to factory reset the device and the device user can continue using the device without losing any data. 6. On the Unenroll screen, click OK to confirm. Alternatively, click Force Unenroll to unenroll the device both from the server and the Knox Manage agent on the device. For information about unenrolling devices from Knox Mobile Enrollment, see Use Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME). Unenroll disconnected devices When a device is unable to communicate with the server, you can send an offline unenrollment code to the device. Then, the user can change the device's status manually and unenroll the device. To unenroll devices that are offline: 1. Identify which device needs to be unenrolled. You might need to contact the device user directly. Instruct them to launch the Knox Manage agent and to go to Settings > Offline Unenrollment. Their User ID, Device Name, and IMEI/MEID are shown. 2. Go to Device on the Knox Manage console. 3. On the Device page, select the device. 4. Click Unenroll. 5. On the confirmation dialog, click Offline Unenrollment Code. 6. Click Force Unenroll. A signal is sent to the device to unenroll it. 7. Instruct the user to enter the offline unenrollment code (from step 5) in the Knox Manage agent's Offline Unenrollment screen. The device unenrolls. You can also find the unenrollment code on the Deleted Devices page. To get the code, go to Device > Deleted Devices. In the dialog that opens, search for the appropriate device. You can find the unenrollment code in the list of results. Consider the following when unenrolling disconnected devices: You can also delete installed apps from a device as it unenrolls. You can delete all internal apps on Android devices and all apps on iPhones running iOS 11 or later. To configure this, go to Setting > Configuration > Basic Configuration > Device, and set Delete App upon Unenrollment to Yes. On a connected device, the Force Unenroll command functions the same as the Unenroll command. On a disconnected device, the Unenroll and Force Unenroll commands are executed the next time the device connects to the Knox Manage servers, and the device is unenrolled. On a disconnected Windows device, if the device unenrollment is unsuccessful, check and disconnect from all enterprise account connections on the device by going to Start > !settings Settings > Accounts > Access work or school. Unenroll groups of devices When you need to unenroll devices in bulk, you can send the unenrollment command to entire device groups at once. Keep in mind that device groups and user groups are fundamentally different types, so you can't unenroll user groups in bulk, even if there are devices associated with them. Accidental use or misuse of this action can have severe consequences on a large number of devices at once. As a precaution, you can only unenroll one group at a time, and the Knox Manage console asks you to confirm your submission twice. To unenroll all the devices in a group: 1. Go to Group. 2. Select a device group. 3. Make sure that you selected the right device group, then click Unenroll Device. A confirmation dialog opens. 4. Read the on-screen warning, then select I have read the warnings and agree to proceed with the process. 5. Click OK to gracefully unenroll the devices or Force Unenroll to push the action through. If you choose the latter option, the console asks you to confirm again. Allow users to unenroll their devices If a device is connected to a network and can establish communication with the server, then users can unenroll the devices by uninstalling the agent. To allow the user to uninstall the agent, complete the following steps: 1. Go to Setting > Configuration > Knox Manage Agent Policy. 2. On the Knox Manage Agent Policy page, click the Default tab. You can also add more agent policy sets by clicking !add. 3. Set the Allow Unenroll Request policy to Allow. 4. Click Save & Apply.",

Enrolling general devices (Android Legacy, iOS, and Windows) With 23.03, Knox Manage no longer supports the Android Legacy (also known as _Device Admin_ ) platform. The Knox Manage team strongly recommends that you migrate to the Android Enterprise platform. For all supported systems, you can enroll a device by sending an installation guide instructing them on how to manually install the Knox Manage agent and sign in to Knox Manage. Before enrolling devices, admins must create a user account to register enrolled devices to it. For more information on creating user accounts, see Register a single user account. To enroll a device in general: 1. Ask the device user to install the Knox Manage agent on the device: Send an Email_Agent Installation template to send a QR code by email template. The QR code links to the Knox Manage agent. For more information, see Send templates or user notifications to users using email. Send a URL or QR code by email or SMS. The URL or QR code is a link to the Knox Manage agent. For more information, see Send enrollment guides to users using email and SMS. Alternatively, the device user can directly find and install the Knox Manage agent on the device's app store. 2. The device user then launches the Knox Manage agent on the device. 3.

For Android Legacy with Knox Workspace devices running Android 10 or higher, tap the enrollment notification on the status bar to install the Knox Workspace manually. In some cases, IT admins may need to enroll specific devices using a manual enrollment method known as Limited Enrollment. For more information on managing devices using the limited enrollment method, see Manage limited enrollment. Enroll Android Enterprise devices Knox Manage supports the following Android Enterprise managed device types. Each manage type can be enrolled differently depending upon your organization's IT and security needs. Fully Managed type - This type allows you to control the entire company-owned device using Knox Manage. To activate as a Fully Managed type, you must first factory reset the device. Fully Managed with a Work Profile type - This type, a combination of the Fully Managed and Work Profile types, allows you to control company-owned devices. You can manage the device's personal area by sending device commands while controlling business apps and data within the separate Work Profile. Users can install and use personal apps on their device's personal area, and, in this case, Knox Manage cannot control apps installed in the personal area or their data. Company-owned with a Work Profile type - This type, a combination of the Fully Managed and Work Profile types, allows you to control company-owned devices with enhanced privacy protection for the personal area. You can manage the device's personal area by sending device commands while controlling business apps and data within the separate Work Profile. Knox Manage cannot control or monitor apps and data in the personal area. This profile type is supported on devices running Android 11 or higher. Work Profile type - This type allows you to control personal devices (BYOD). In this case, Knox Manage only manages the Work Profile - the work area separated from the personal area - on the device. In order for Knox Manage to track the location of Android 11 and higher devices, the device user must grant the Knox Manage agent location access. This affects devices with the following deployment types: Bring your own device (BYOD) with a Work Profile, Shared devices with a secondary account You should inform users with these devices that after device enrollment and installation of the Knox Manage agent, they must allow the following access settings: Android 11: 1. When the Knox Manage agent requests location access, the user must select While using this app. 2. Then, they must go to Work profile settings > Apps > Knox Manage > App permissions, and set Location to Allow all the time. Android 12 and higher: When the Knox Manage agent requests location access, the user must select Precise and While using this app. #Enroll as the Fully Managed type Enroll Android devices in the Fully Managed type to control the whole area of the device. You must factory reset the device in advance. Select one of the following methods. Method Supported version Use a token (afw#KnoxManage) Android 6 and higher Use Android Zero-touch enrollment Android 11 and higher Use a QR code sent by email Android 7 and higher Use Knox Mobile Enrollment Android 8 to 10 (Android Legacy) Android 8 and higher (Android Enterprise) #Enroll as the Fully Managed with a Work Profile type Enroll the Android devices as the Fully Managed with a Work Profile type to control the separate work and personal areas. The enrollment methods are the same as those for the Fully Managed type, but this type can be enabled by selecting Fully Managed with a Work Profile option on Add/Modify User. For more information, see Register a single user account. This profile type is supported on devices running Android version 8 to 10. In cases where a device is enrolling in the Fully Managed with a Work Profile mode over a Wi-Fi network with no cellular data connection, an issue may occur if that device's profile has a Wi-Fi configuration policy. At the point where the device is creating a Work Profile area, it is temporarily disconnected from the Wi-Fi network to use the Wi-Fi network configured in the policy. This temporary disconnection causes the Work Profile creation to fail, and the device remains in Fully Managed mode. The device user must re-enroll the device to resolve the issue.

This may take several minutes. 4. After setup completes, tap Open App, then, if you consent to Google's Terms of service, tap Continue. The Knox Manage agent begins installing on the smartwatch. 5. When finished, the app notifies you that You're all set. The watch detaches from the phone and begins to operate as a standalone device. 6. If you have another watch that you want to enroll, tap Pair another watch to repeat the same process. Step 4 - Confirm Wear OS enrollment After you enroll your Wear OS device, it's a good idea to verify that enrollment succeeded and that you are able to manage your smartwatch from Knox Manage. There are three methods to verify successful enrollment, directly from the smartwatch itself. You only have to use one of these methods to confirm that the smartwatch was successfully enrolled. 1. On the smartwatch, check that Wi-Fi is turned on and that the watch is on the same network as the phone. 2. Look for a notification from Knox Manage that says Updated by your admin. 3. In Settings, go to Security, and confirm that a Managed device info button is present. If you see this, then your smartwatch has been successfully been enrolled.",

            "content": "Enroll a Windows device with Entra ID. If your Knox Manage tenant syncs Active Directory resources from your Microsoft Entra tenant, you can enroll and provision Windows devices in your fleet with your users' Entra accounts. Enrolling with Entra ID offers the benefits of rapid cloud-based provisioning technology like Windows Out of Box Experience and Windows Autopilot. In the Entra ecosystem, there are two types of managed devices: Device type Definition Microsoft Entra registered device A BYOD device such as an employee-owned laptop, a 2-in-1 computers, a tablet, or a phone. For a full description of this type, see Microsoft Entra registered devices in the Microsoft docs. Microsoft Entra joined device A company-owned device such as a workstation, a laptop, a 2-in-1 computer, a tablet, or a kiosk. For a full description of this type, see Microsoft Entra joined devices in the Microsoft docs. Depending on your enterprise needs and deployment strategy, there are four available methods for enrolling and provisioning devices in Knox Manage through Entra ID: Method Pathway Windows Settings Provisioning an enterprise user account by adding it as Windows account. Available for registered and joined devices. Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE) Enrolling a device in the startup wizard when the device is first turned on. Available for joined devices. Windows Autopilot Enrolling a device with a customized OOBE profile. Available for joined devices. Provisioning package (PPKG) Enrolling a device with a configuration file. Available for joined devices. Before you can begin enrolling Windows devices using these methods, you must configure your Knox Manage tenant to sync information with your Azure tenant.

            "content": "Automated Device Enrollment quickstart. Apple's Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) allows you to quickly and easily enroll a large number of organization-owned Apple devices. Devices added by ADE enroll automatically without user intervention with the configured device management profiles. At a high level, enrolling a device through ADE and Knox Manage proceeds like this: 1. You obtain an ADE token from Apple. 2. You register the devices on Apple Business Manager. 3. You configure an ADE profile for the devices. 4. The device user receives the device, then signs in to the Knox Manage agent, completing enrollment. Requirements To use ADE, you must meet the following prerequisites: Have Apple devices running iOS 10 or higher, or iPadOS. Register for an Apple Business account on Apple Business Manager or upgrade from the older Device Enrollment Program. To learn more, consult Upgrade your organization to Apple Business Manager in Apple support. Connect your tenant to the Automated Device Enrollment service To enroll devices through ADE, you must connect your Knox Manage tenant to the ADE service, which requires sharing a key and token between Knox Manage and Apple Business Manager. To issue an ADE token and set it up with your Knox Manage tenant: 1. Go to Device Enrollment > Apple ADE > ADE Server Setting. If you have issued an ADE token before, the previously-issued ADE token's information and its expiration date are displayed. 2. Click Download Public Key to download your public key required to create a new MDM server on the Apple ADE Portal. The file uses the PEM format. 3. Go to https://deploy.apple.com and sign in with your Apple Business account. 4. When prompted, enter the 6-digit verification code sent to the mobile device registered to your enterprise's Apple ID. The start screen opens. 5. Go to Settings > Device Management Settings, then click Add MDM Server. 6. Configure the MDM server settings, upload your public key, and then click Save. 7. Click Download Token to download your ADE token. The file uses the P7M format. To avoid authentication conflicts, use one ADE token per EMM tenant. 8. Back on the Knox Manage console, click Upload ADE Token and upload your token. 9. Click OK. If the upload and initial handshake succeeds, then your Knox Manage tenant can successfully authenticate with the Apple ADE server. 10. Click Set ADE Default Profile and configure the base enrollment settings of devices enrolled through ADE. 11. Click Set ADE Device Sync Interval to specify how frequently your tenant syncs with the ADE server. Register an Apple device for ADE After connecting your tenant to the ADE service, you can register an Apple device for ADE on Apple Business Manager through an authorized reseller or the Apple Configurator app on your Mac. Before you begin, make sure to register your Knox Manage tenant with Apple Business Manager: 1. Sign in to Apple Business Manager with your enterprise's Apple ID. 2. In Apple Configurator, add the Knox Manage server URL on the Preferences > Organizations and Servers tabs. The URL is the one you see in your web browser for the Knox Manage console, followed by /ios/depenroll. To register an Apple device on Apple Business Manager: 1. Connect the device to your Mac through USB. 2. In Apple Configurator, select the device and click Prepare. 3. When prompted for what to do, click Manual Configuration, then Add to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager. Then, select Allow devices to pair with other computers and click Next. 4.

            "content": "Use bulk enrollment based on PPKG in Windows 10 and Windows 11. Introduction The Windows bulk device enrollment process - also known as Windows provisioning - allows IT admins to configure target devices without imaging each device separately. Using Windows provisioning, IT admins can quickly and seamlessly set up the device configuration and settings for the entire enrollment process and deploy these configurations to devices in bulk. For this purpose, we use a provisioning package file - a PPKG file - that is a container for a collection of configuration settings. You can create this file using a Windows device and later use it to configure and set up Windows devices without any user interaction. For more information about Windows provisioning packages, see Provisioning packages for Windows. Before using bulk enrollment for Windows devices To use a PPKG file to bulk enroll Windows devices, you must meet the following prerequisites: Knox Manage console: Administrator access rights and privileges for your account on the Knox Manage console. Configured the enrollment settings under Device Enrollment > Windows > Enrollment Settings on the Knox Manage console. Device to create the PPKG file: Windows 10 or Windows 11 with the Windows Configuration Designer software installed. Administrator privileges to create the provisioning package. Target devices: Running Windows 10 or Windows 11. Administrator privileges to run the provisioning package. #Benefits of using a provisioning package There are a few major benefits of using a Windows provisioning package to enroll and configure devices: One-time setup - The entire provisioning process is a one-time setup process where the device users just need to power-on the device, connect to the network, and install the PPKG file to enroll with Knox Manage. Bulk enrollment - This process allows a large scale rollout of corporate-owned devices. IT admins just need to create the PPKG file and share it with all the corporate users who need to set up their devices. IT admins can then manage the devices enrolled in bulk using the MDM of their choice. Set up kiosks or special use devices - IT admins can also customize the PPKG to configure and enroll special use devices such as: Kiosks like ATMs or point-of-sale (POS) terminals , School devices used by students in an educational organization , Industrial machinery , Handheld devices used on the sales floor #Stages of the provisioning process The provisioning process includes the following stages: Assign use, Create PPKG, Deliver PPKG, Install PPKG, Install and Enroll Knox Manage Client Depending upon the purpose of configuring the device and specific customer needs, the IT admin can choose to assign one of three user types to the device user. The following image describes these three types: Bulk enroll devices #Assign users During the bulk enrollment process, Knox Manage first adds the MDM Work account to the device, and after that, the Knox Manage Client app gets installed to the device automatically. By default, Knox Manage does not assign devices to any user during the bulk enrollment process. IT admins have to manually or automatically assign users using the Assign User settings using one of the following three use cases: Assign a default user for all devices, Assign bulk users for each device using a CSV file, Assign a single user for each device ##Assign a default user This use case is available to devices before the PPKG file is installed and the device is enrolled in Knox Manage. Once a device is enrolled using this default user, you cannot change the user's information later. If you want to enroll devices using a default user, the device's information must not already exist in the Knox Manage admin console > Device Management menu. To assign a user: 1. In the Knox Manage console, go to Device Enrollment > Windows > Enrollment Setting > scroll to the User Assign section. 2. Specify whether the user is a default user or not by selecting a value for the Using Default User field: Yes - Choose this option if you want to assign this user as a default user for all appropriate devices. No - Choose this option if you do not want to assign this user as a default user. 3. Specify a value for the User ID field by clicking Select. On the dialog that opens, scroll to select the appropriate user ID. 4. Click Save to save your changes. ##Assign bulk users Bulk assignment of users is available as an option before you can assign a default user. The value of the Computer Name field must be set to Serial Number of the device. Even if you set up the device to use the Default User from the Enrollment Setting menu, the Bulk Assign Users setting takes priority over the default user setting. To assign users in bulk: Before you can use automatic assignment on devices, you must set the device name to the serial number. 1. In the Knox Manage console, go to Device Enrollment > Windows > Device Management > click Bulk Assign User. 2. In the Bulk Assign Users dialog that opens, click Download Template to download an Excel file that you can customize to include the appropriate user and device information. Ensure that the file you create has Digital Rights Management (DRM) disabled. Before you upload this Excel file, add the User ID you want to assign to the Knox Manage console. 3. Click !upload to select the appropriate file. 4. Click OK to upload the file to the Knox Manage console. ##Assign a single user You can assign a single user to each device only after you've installed PPKG and enrolled the device in Knox Manage. To use this setting you must set the Using Default User setting in the Enrollment Setting menu to No. To assign a single user to a device: You can only assign a user to a device that is active and does not currently have a user assigned. 1. In the Knox Manage console, go to Device Enrollment > Windows > Device Management > scroll to the device to which you want to assign a user, and click the checkbox to select the device and then click Assign User. 2. In the Select User dialog that opens, click the User Name for the user you want to assign to the device. 3. Click OK to assign the user to the selected device. #Create and customize the PPKG You can create the PPKG using the Windows Configuration Designer (WCD) tool. To create and customize the PPKG file: 1. Download and install the Windows Configuration Designer tool from the Microsoft Store. For information on how to install the WCD tool, see Microsoft documentation > Install the Windows Configuration Designer. 2. Use the WCD tool to create a project: 1. Open the Windows Configuration Designer, and click Advanced Provisioning. 2. Enter a project name and click Next. 3. When prompted, select All Windows editions, since Enrollment Setting is common to all Windows 10 and Windows 11 editions, then click Next. 4. Optionally, you can skip importing a provisioning package, and finally click Finish. 3. In the WCD tool, customize the PPKG settings: 1. Expand Runtime settings and choose Workplace > Enrollments. 2. Provide the User Principal Name (UPN) for the Windows enrollment here. For Bulk Enrollment, you can get the UPN from the Knox Manage console by going to Device Enrollment > Windows > Enrollment Setting > Bulk Enrollment > copy the provided UPN. 3. Enter the copied UPN and click Add. 4. On the left navigation menu, expand the UPN and then enter the information for the rest of the settings for enrollment process: AuthPolicy > Select OnPremise. DiscoveryServiceFullUrl > Same as UPN, use the Discovery Service URL provided by Knox Manage. EnrollmentServiceFullUrl > Optional and in most cases, it should be left blank. PolicyServiceFullUrl > Optional and in most cases, it should be left blank. Secret > Same as UPN, use the Secret provided by Knox Manage. 4. Use the WCD tool to build the provisioning package: 1. Click Export and select Provisioning package. 2. Provide the following details, and click Next. Name - This field is pre-populated with the Project Name, and you can customize it as necessary. Version (in _Major.Minor_ format) - This field is optional, and represents the default package version. You can change the current version by specifying a new value. Owner - Select the appropriate ownership type here. Rank - Choose a package rank between 0-99. The default rank is 0. 3. Enter the following values for your package file. If the package contains sensitive data that must not be compromised, you can select the required security type. Encrypt package - Select this option to enrypt the package file. You must also provice an encrption password. Sign package - If you sign the package file, you must provide a valid certificate. Click Browse to open a file browse dialog and attach your certificate file. 4. Provide the destination path where you want to save the package file, and then click Next. 5. Click Build. You can find this information about the PPKG file on the Knox Manage console on the Device Enrollment > Windows > Enrollment Setting > on the Bulk Enrollment page go to the Provisioning Package Reference section. #Deliver, install, and enroll with the PPKG Once you create the PPKG, you can deliver it to your users either using a USB flash or another external drive, network drive, or as an email attachment. Firstly the device users can install the PPKG file by double-clicking the PPKG file after saving it on the local storage. Or they can install the PPKG file via Windows setting only if they have saved it in USB or SD card: Windows Settings > Access work or school > Add or Remove a provisioning package > Add a package. On the target device, administrator-level device users have to double-click the PPKG file to run it. Alternatively, they can run the file in administrator PowerShell with the following command, replacing name with the name of your PPKG file: Install-ProvisioningPackage -PackagePath _name_.ppkg -QuietInstall After the device users install the PPKG files on their devices, the Knox Manage client is automatically installed on the device and the device is enrolled to the Knox Manage console. Device users can verify that the enrollment process was successful on their device, by navigating to Settings > Accounts > Access work or school. They can check the installed PPKG file using the Add or Remove a provisioning package setting. Unenroll devices and delete the PPKG file from devices If you want to retry bulk enrollment using a PPKG file: 1. First, unenroll the device using the Knox Manage admin console or using the Disconnect button in Settings > Accounts > Access work or school. 2. Next, click Add or remove a provisioning package and follow on-screen instructions to remove the previously installed PPKG file.

            "content": "Migrate Android Legacy to Android Enterprise. With 23.03, Knox Manage no longer supports the Android Legacy (also known as _Device Admin_ ) platform. The Knox Manage team strongly recommends that you migrate to the Android Enterprise platform Overview This guide provides information on how to migrate from Android Legacy device administrator (DA) to Android Enterprise (AE) while using Knox Manage (KM). For devices running Android OS 11 or higher, the Android Legacy activation mode is no longer available for new enrollments in Knox Manage. This guide aims to support IT admins in their transition from Android Legacy (AL) to Android Enterprise (AE) for new and existing enrollments. This document includes the following information: AL to AE migration instructions, Benefits of migrating to AE, Tips and recommendations related to preparing devices for migration #Audience The document is addressed to IT administrators, who use Knox Manage to manage Android Legacy devices, including enrolling new devices with Android OS 11 or higher and migrating devices running Android OS 10 or lower. This guide touches on Android Enterprise concepts, however, we assume the reader has a basic understanding of mobility management on Android devices. #Migration purpose To better support today's enterprise requirements, Android is deprecating Device Admin and is replacing it with Device Owner. This change makes it impossible to use Device Admin enrollment for EMM solutions. For Knox Manage those changes are reflected on devices running Android OS 11 or higher. Going forward, IT admins can only use the Android Enterprise activation mode for device enrollment. Migrate your devices #Before you begin Before you start migrating your devices, take time to carefully consider the various migration scenarios, their advantages, limitations, and the various possible use cases. #Migration steps Using Knox Manage, migrate your devices to Android Enterprise as follows: 1. Choose the appropriate Android Enterprise device management mode. 2. Choose a device migration strategy. 3. Review solution deployment scenarios and choose a solution deployment method. 4. Configure the Android Enterprise . For more information Android 11 and how it impacts you, see What's new in Android 11. ##Device migration strategy In the context of devices that are currently enrolled and activated in Android Legacy, it is important to approach your device migration strategy with care. There are many factors which influence the choices that determine this strategy, such as: Devices' compatibility with Android Enterprise or possibility for OS upgrades - Android Enterprise enrollment in Knox Manage is supported from Android 6.0. If your devices are running a version Android OS prior to Android 6.0 and there is no way to upgrade them to Android 6.0 or higher, then we recommend replacing your devices. If replacing these devices is not an option, we recommend using these activated Android Legacy devices until the end of their lifecycle. An important point to note here is that for Android Legacy devices, starting with Knox Manage 23.03 in March 2023, we will no longer offer new features, bug fixes, or technical support. Chosen AE management mode - Depending on the type of device activation, there are different actions necessary for each device. If you want to migrate devices from Android Legacy to AE Work Profile, you must re-enroll devices in Knox Manage. However, if you prefer to use the Fully Managed, Fully Managed with Work Profile, or Work Profile on company-owned modes, then you must factory reset your devices, which means that those devices lose all stored data. Both of these options are time consuming and require manual interaction with the device, causing a lot of hassles for the device users and IT admins. Activation of AE is possible only during the use of device set up wizard or during MDM enrollment. Possibility of devices replacement or fleet extension - If you plan to replace your device fleet in the near future and do not want to bother your users with additional device configuration tasks, we recommend keeping your currently enrolled devices as-is until the end of their lifecycle. You can then start migrating new devices to AE. With this option, IT admins may need to manage both AE and Android Legacy in the Knox Manage console, but gradually the device fleet will completely migrate to Android Enterprise. Availability of management policies - While considering different AE device management modes, you must take into consideration the differences between Android Enterprise and Android Legacy policies. It is critical to consider these policy differences when deciding on a device migration strategy for currently enrolled devices. We recommend that you check the policy mapping before you plan your migration. For a detailed mapping of AL and AE policies, see Android Legacy to Android Enterprise Features mapping. ##Solution deployment scenarios Another decision to be made before starting actual migration is to decide how you plan to deploy the new configuration to devices. There are a few methods depending on the Android Enterprise activation mode you have selected. It is up to the IT admin to decide what scenario fits the your needs the best However, regardless of the AE management mode you choose, if you want to migrate currently enrolled Android Legacy devices, you must re-enroll these devices in Knox Manage. You can only activate Android Enterprise during device enrollment. The following Android Enterprise enrollment options available in Knox Manage: 1. Single or manual enroll process, which includes: 1. Token (DPC identifier) 2. QR code via Email 3. Knox Manage agent app installation from Google Play For more information, see Enroll a single device. 2. Bulk enrollment using Knox Mobile Enrollment for Samsung's Android devices. For more information see Use Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME). 3. Bulk enrollment using Android zero-touch for non-Samsung Android devices. For more information see Use Android zero-touch enrollment (Android devices only). Depending upon your AE activation mode, there are a few different options available to you. For details, see the following table. Android management mode KM agent installation Token QR code Knox Mobile Enrollment Zero-touch Work Profile &#x2022; Fully Managed &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; Corporate owned Single Use &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; Fully Managed with Work Profile &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; Work Profile on Company Owned &#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022; Set up Knox Manage configuration Knox Manage offers a rich set of features that IT admins can use to manage and optimize their device fleet. This section describes the configuration settings that we recommend that IT admins use to ensure devices are migrated to Android Enterprise seamlessly. Note that the following instructions are intended to improve the migration process, but are only guidelines and recommendations. Determining the right migration model depends upon your IT needs and specifics of your device fleet. #Get started with Knox Manage IT administrators must complete the following steps configure Android Enterprise in Knox Manage: 1. Activating Android Enterprise in Knox Manage 2. Creating AE management profiles in Knox Manage 3. Recreating application management structure for Manage Google Play Store 4. Triggering proper devices' re-enrollment For information on getting started with Knox Manage, see Video: Getting Started with Knox Manage for Android Enterprise. #Configure the Android Enterprise environment To use Android Enterprise devices, you must register Samsung Knox Manage as the EMM provider in the Google Play console and configure the basic environment of Managed Google Play. See Configure the Android Enterprise environment for detailed instructions. Additionally, to ensure devices are triggered to enroll to AE, IT admins must change their activation mode. You can find this setting in Knox Manage under User and Organization options. To change this activation setting: For devices in bulk for a group of users - In Knox Manage, go to the Organization tab > choose the one you want to change > click Modify > change the setting as follows. For changing the settings for a single user - In Knox Manage, go to the Users tab > find appropriate user and click to open the user profile > click Modify > change the setting as follows. For an entire organization - You can set the option Follow Organization type to trigger user enrollment based on the settings for the Organization that the user belongs to. Depending on device deployment method, the devices are enrolled in either Fully Managed or Work Profile on company-owned modes (for set up wizard enrollment), or Work Profile (for manual agent installation) mode. Note that if you want to create a Fully Managed with Work Profile mode on Android 8 to 10 devices, you must set Fully Managed with Work Profile to Yes: #Create AE management profiles in Knox Manage The next step is to create proper device management profiles for Android Enterprise activations. While you can use the same profile structure that you are using with Android Legacy, you must create and add a new platform - namely, Android Enterprise - to each profile's options. To add a new platform, in Knox Manage, go to the Profile tab > find the proper profile and open it > click Modify Profile Info > check Android Enterprise > and then click Save & Set Polices. While setting up polices you can see the Profile Platform on the left hand side and policies on right hand side. To set up Android Enterprise polices open the appropriate category: Depending upon your device's activation mode, the IT admin needs to set up policies as follows: 1. Work Profile mode - Use the Work Profile column settings (the right column). 2. Fully Managed mode, use General Area column settings (the left column). 3. Corporate owned Single Use, use Kiosk category in Android Enterprise Platform Policies. 4. Fully Managed with Work Profile mode - Use the combination of both General Area and Work Profile settings (a combination of the left and right columns simultaneously). 5. Work Profile on Corporate Owned device - Use the combination of both General Area and Work Profile settings, that is a combination of the left and right columns simultaneously. However before you start to set up the company-owned Device Policies as shown here, ensure that you know which policies work for General area in that activation mode. ##Recreate the application management structure When migrating to Android Enterprise as an IT Admin, you must remember that currently added applications in Android Legacy are not available in the new mode. For publicly available applications, the best option to push application installation is to use Managed Google Play Store. Read more about the entire application approval process. You can also change the currently added applications to AE ones. Doing so only requires a few steps. For applications added to the console from the Google Play Store, you can switch them from Android Legacy mode to Android Enterprise mode as follows: 1. Navigate to Application > Click the name of the application. 2. Scroll down the page and click Approve. 3. On the Approve screen, click OK. If your company uses internal applications, you must add these applications to a Managed Google Play Private. However, note that to add application to the Managed Google Play Private, first you must remove these applications from the Knox Manage admin portal > internal apps. For more information on this entire process, see Add apps using Managed Google Play. Managed Google Play Private applications must meet the following conditions: The name of the application package must be unique in Google Play (you cannot add applications with the same name that are already in the general Google shop). The APK must be optimized to use RAM. The key (certificate) used to sign the APK must have a long validity period. For more information see Best practices for private apps. ##Deploying configuration to devices There are three main Android Enterprise enrollment options in Knox Manage: 1. Work Profile type (private device) recommended activation methods: Manual process - The user installs Knox Manage Agent application manually on their private device using private Google account on Google Play Store. After installation in the Knox Manage Agent, the user enters the registration data - that is, user login and password - provided by the IT administrator. For more information, see Enroll as the Work Profile type. 2. Fully Managed type (new device or after a factory reset): Activation token - Manual activation. In the set up wizard configurator of your phone, go to the Google account sign in screen, enter afw#KnoxManage. For more information, see Use a token. QR Code - Manual activation. In the case of the fully managed mode,Knox Manage's manual enrollment process requires the use of a special QR code, that you can find in the enrollment e-mail sent to the user by your IT Admin, the following shows a sample code: You must scan that code during the set up wizard configuration.

Each device can have any of the following connection statuses: ![](../../../assets/B-device_enrolled.png) Enrolled - The device is communicating with the Knox Manage server. That is, the Knox Manage agent is reporting to the server regularly and when triggered by an event. ![](../../../assets/B-device_disconnected.png) Disconnected - The device is disconnected from the Knox Manage server. The Knox Manage agent has not reported to the server for longer than the configured keepalive expiration. ![](../../../assets/B-device_unenrolled.png) Unenrolled - The device is not enrolled and is not under Knox Manage control. ![](../../../assets/B-device_provisioning.png) Provisioning - The devices are in the process of being registered in the Knox Manage server and once the process is complete, the status changes to Enrolled. ![](../../../assets/B-device_expired.png) Expired - The license registered on the device has expired. For such devices, you can only send some device commands to the device - such as update or upgrade license - from the Knox Manage server. How connection status is evaluated When a device is enrolled in Knox Manage, the server maintains information on when it was last able to communicate with that device. That time is recorded as the device's Last Seen property. The Last Seen property is updated each time any of the following events occur: The Knox Manage agent reports to the server. By default, the agent automatically sends a keepalive message to the server every 6 hours. The device user launches the Knox Manage agent on the device, which causes the agent to report to the server. Do any of the following: Execute an update to a profile assigned to the device. This option causes the Last Seen property to be updated immediately. Set up Profile Update Schedule in Setting > Configuration > Profile Update Schedule. This option updates the Last Seen property based on the schedule you set. Set up the Report device location policy in an Android Enterprise or Android Legacy profile that is assigned to the device. This option updates the Last Seen property based on the Report device location interval you set. The device's Last Seen property directly affects its connection status in the Knox Manage admin portal. If the server has not seen the device for longer than the keepalive expiration, it changes the device's status from Enrolled to Disconnected. For information on how to configure the keepalive settings, see Configure the Keepalive settings.",

An employee-owned device with a Work Profile running Android 12 and higher does not share its IMEI/MEID hardware identifier with Knox Manage. Instead, Knox Manage associates it with a unique _enrollment identifier_, which is displayed in the IMEI/MEID field. This identifier persists across re-deployments. For iPad models that support cellular networks and dual SIMs (both a physical SIM card and an eSIM), only one IMEI number is displayed on the Device Details page. User Name > Detail - Takes you to the User Details page, where you can view the device user's profile. See History - View the Knox Manage's enrollment and provisioning history of the device.

Knox Manage allows the following license changes: Active license Available license change Knox Manage Knox Suite Knox Manage with Knox Platform for Enterprise Knox Manage with Knox Platform for Enterprise Knox Suite Knox Manage Knox Suite Knox Manage with Knox Platform for Enterprise Knox Manage (only new licenses with the KLM12 prefix) , License conversion is supported on devices with Knox Manage agent 21.7 or later. If you intend to change licenses on devices running Knox Manage agent 21.6 and lower, you must first update their Knox Manage agent. With 23.03, a new Knox Manage license (with the _KLM12_ prefix) is available, which provides standard Knox Manage features as well as all Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) features. The legacy Knox Manage license (with the _KLM9_ prefix) is being deprecated. You must update to the new Knox Manage license. If multiple Knox Manage licenses with both the _KLM9_ and _KLM12_ prefixes exist in a tenant, the older _KLM9_ license is shown as Legacy Knox Manage in the console. Change your Knox Manage license To change your active Knox Manage license to a different type: 1. On the Knox Manage console, go to Setting > License, then click Change License. 2. Select a license conversion, then click OK. Your Knox Manage license changes to the chosen type. Change a Knox Suite license to Knox Manage with KPE license When changing a Knox Suite license to a Knox Manage with Knox Platform for Enterprise license, you must perform some additional steps in order to preserve the existing device enrollments in your tenant. The license change process requires you to first activate the KPE license and then downgrade your Knox suite license. After, you must push the changed license to a selection of organizations or users. The license then cascades to any devices associated with those organizations or users, which ensures enrollment continuity for those devices. To change a Knox Suite license to a Knox Manage with KPE license: 1. On the Knox dashboard, hover over Knox Platform for Enterprise and click Generate. 2. On the Knox Manage console, go to Setting > License, then click Change License. 3. Select Knox Suite \u2192 Knox Manage with KPE, then click OK. 4.

For more information about purchasing licenses, contact the Knox Manage support team. Licenses are granted and revoked in the order in which the devices were enrolled. Attempting to register devices in excess of the device count will result in failure. License FAQs , Q - What happens when my Knox Manage trial license expires? A - You can obtain a retail or another trial Knox Suite license, when your trial license expires. Q - How are Knox Manage licenses allocated to devices? A - Licenses with shorter expiration dates will be allocated first following the First Expired/First Out (FEFO) method. Q - Once the total number of licenses is increased through renewal or extension, how are they allocated? A - If there are more licenses than devices after the increase, licenses are allocated to all devices in the order in which they were enrolled. Q - If there are more devices than licenses after increasing the number of licenses, how are the licenses allocated? A - Licenses are allocated to devices in the order that the devices were enrolled. Extra devices without licenses become unavailable with the existing policy still applied. Q - When I renew an expired license, does the license come into effect and enroll the relevant devices immediately? A - For iOS and Windows devices, they are enrolled immediately. For Android devices, they can be enrolled according to the schedule set on the system or by sending a device command. Q - When a license expires, does it expire in the order the devices were enrolled? A - When a license being used on various devices expires, all the devices become unable to use Knox Manage simultaneously. Q - If I want to allocate the renewed licenses only to new devices (not already existing registered devices), what should I do? A - After increasing the number of licenses, you should first unenroll the existing registered devices, and then enroll the new devices. The renewed licenses will then be allocated to the new devices. Q - When a factory reset command is sent from the Knox Manage console to a device, will the license be revoked automatically? A - The license will be revoked automatically if the factory reset is completed successfully. If the factory reset fails, the license will not be revoked and the device will become unenrolled. Q - Which license is used for Windows and Chrome OS devices? A - Windows and Chrome OS devices are enrolled with Knox Manage licenses.",

Profiles allow you to configure policies to control device functions and data, such as the camera, screen lock, Bluetooth, or firewalls, quickly and efficiently. With profiles, you can also install the Wi-Fi, VPN, and Exchange settings for your enterprise on user devices. Profiles can also be configured to run in specific situations, such as at a specific time or when the device is running a specific application. To add policies to a profile, see Configure profile policies by device platform. To then link and deploy these policies, see Assign profiles to groups and organizations. When multiple profiles are assigned to the same group or organization, if the policies they configure overlap, they will conflict, because a device can only receive and apply one unique configuration for any particular policy at a time. In these cases, only the policy from the group or organization with the highest priority will be apply. For instance, if one profile assigned to a group enables the camera access, but another profile assigned to the same group disables it, the camera policy from the profile with the highest priority will apply to the group. Disparate policies from multiple profiles apply if they don't conflict with each other. To configure profile priority, see Set up the profile priorities.",

If two or more values have been configured for the same category on a device, then the user must select a category and apply the settings manually, except for Wi-Fi settings. However, the bookmark settings cannot be applied automatically if the Installation area field is set to Shortcut. Refer to the following table for an example: Category , Value , Application type - , - , - Wi-Fi , AB , Auto application VPN , C , Auto application Exchange , DF , Manual application Device settings can be applied automatically once Knox Manage is activated and the policies are applied. After the application is complete, you can see the results in a notification message. Preparations To apply configurations automatically, do the following: When using certificates and VPN settings in the Wi-Fi 802.1xEAP framework, install Credential Storage (CS) so that trusted certificates can be stored in advance. CS installation means locking the screen using an option more secure than a password. For the Knox VPN setting, install the Vendor Client in advance. For the Email and Exchange settings, install the Samsung Email app and agree to receive notifications from the Email app (Galaxy S8 or higher). For the Knox workspace, install the VPN Vendor Client in the general area. Restrictions In the following cases, manual intervention is still required even configurations are applied automatically. A Wi-Fi connection needs to be established in the device settings since devices cannot connect to a Wi-Fi AP automatically. To connect a tunnel after installing a VPN or Knox VPN, it must be enabled manually. If the user deletes the auto-applied configuration, the deleted configuration is automatically reapplied when the device is manually rebooted or restarted. Categories of auto application Configurations applied automatically can be categorized into Cases A, B, and C: Category Description Application order Case A Settings that can be applied and updated immediately after Knox Manage is activated and policies are applied. Application and updates can be performed automatically in the Knox Workspace area once it is created and policies are applied. The Email and Exchange settings require installation of the Samsung Email application. For Wi-Fi 802.1xEAP, select PEAP in the EAP Methods, which is an authentication protocol, to prevent the usage of certificates. The user does not need to select a screen lock type and add it when auto-installing Wi-Fi settings, because this doesn't require installation of Credential Storage (CS). Auto application of the Bookmark settings is supported on devices running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or Android 7.0 (Nougat), and only when the Installation area field is set to Bookmark. However, the Bookmark settings cannot be applied automatically on Android Enterprise devices. APN &gt; Bookmark &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Exchange &gt; Email Case B Settings that can be applied or updated once a screen lock password is set and additional applications or certifications are installed. If no screen lock password has been set, configurations are not applied automatically and a notification message for setting the screen lock password shows instead. Tap Set password on the notification message to open the settings screen of the device. Wi-Fi &gt; VPN &gt; Knox VPN Case C Settings that must be applied manually by the user from Knox Manage. If you set up Exchange with a certificate, it is categorized as Case B because it requires certificate installation. The following table provides more information.

Fully Managed &mdash; Android 6 and higher, Samsung Knox 2.0 and higher Work Profile &mdash; Android 12 and higher Personal area &mdash; Android 12 and higher Enforce Multi-factor Authentication Enable multifactor authentication (2FA) that unlocks a device only after two authentication methods are provided, including one biometric input&mdash;face, iris, or fingerprint&mdash;and one lock screen method, such as PIN, password, or pattern. Note Incorrect use of this policy together with One Lock and Biometric policy can lock your device. Fully Managed &mdash; Samsung Knox 3.0 and higher Screen Timeout Specify whether to allow the user to control the screen lock time setting. Fully Managed &mdash; Android 9.0 and higher Password Configures password and device lock screen settings. Policy Description Supported system Password Set the device's lock screen type and minimum quality. Use of the camera is prohibited when the device is locked. You can set up to two lock screen policy sets: Device Controls &mdash; The lock screen settings for the personal area of the device. Work Profile Controls &mdash; The lock screen settings for a device's Work Profile. After the Work Profile is set up, the device user is directed to set a lock screen. Important For the Fully Managed type and the Fully Managed with Work Profile type, if the strength of the lock screen is lower than the requirements of the policy, the device is locked through the Lock Task mode. The device user can't use any other functions until they set a lock screen. If the device user creates a lock screen for the Work Profile that does not comply with the password policy's requirements, all apps on the Work Profile&mdash;except essential apps like Knox Manage&mdash;are suspended. Suspending the apps, as opposed to just hiding them, offers greater security since unauthorized users cannot gain access to any Work Profile data. If the device is using a One Lock password and the policy for the personal area and Work Profile are configured differently, the stronger password policy is applied. During enrollment of company-owned devices with a Work Profile, the Knox Manage agent prompts the device user to set locks for the personal profile and Work Profile. If the device is rebooted before the locks are set, Managed Google Play functionality might be inhibited or the device might become bricked. For more details and remedies, see How to enforce a password policy during enrollment for company-owned devices with a Work Profile. Tip If a user forgets their password and contacts you, you should send the device command to reset the password and guide them to enter the temporary password. For more information about this procedure, see View details of a device. &gt; Minimum Complexity (Android 12 or higher) Set the minimum lock screen complexity. There are four complexity levels, each pre-defined by the Android API. The device user must use a lock screen that meets or exceeds the minimum level.

            "content": "Chrome OS policies. This page describes the policies that you can configure for Chromebooks. Chrome OS policies can be in one of several possible states: Set - A setting is chosen, and it changes behavior. Set and default - A setting is chosen, but it doesn't change any behavior because it's the same as the default. Set and user-defined - A setting is chosen, but it allows the device user to specify the behavior on the Chromebook. Unset and user-defined - No setting is chosen, and the device user can specify the behavior on the Chromebook. In order to help reduce potential confusion, settings labelled (default) in a policy description indicate default system and user account behavior. There may also be notation that describes unique default behavior when a policy is unset, or system behavior that by default the device user has control over. Unless otherwise specified, _managed user_ or _device user_ refers to someone who has signed in to an enrolled Chromebook with a Google account associated with one of your organizations. _Unmanaged user_ refers to someone who has signed in to an enrolled Chromebook with an unassociated Google account.

Values Perform DNS interception checks (default) Do not perform DNS interception checks Chrome OS 99 and higher Intranet Redirection Behavior Toggles treating a single-word query in the omnibox as a hostname rather than a search term on Chrome browser. When enabled, if the device user searches for a single word, Chrome browser issues a DNS request for the term as a hostname, and then asks the user if they want to try and connect to the query as a URL rather than search for it. An example would be a search for calendar that matches an internal host http://calendar/ . If your network resolves every DNS request for a single-word host, you should allow interception checks with the DNS interception checks enabled policy. However, this Intranet Redirection Behavior policy is more flexible because with it you can also enable the prompt (infobar) that the device user sees. Values Use default browser behavior (default) &mdash; DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions are enabled. Google plans to deprecate this setting in the future. Disable DNS interception checks and did-you-mean \"http://intranetsite/\" infobars &mdash; Chrome treats a single-word query as a search, and does not check whether hostnames are being redirected by the DNS. Disable DNS interception checks; allow did-you-mean \"http://intranetsite/\" infobars &mdash; Chrome asks the device user whether it should redirect their single-word query to a hostname, and does not check whether hostnames are being redirected by the DNS.

After, to deploy the policies, you can apply the profile to the assigned organization or group. Going forward, for devices running a Work Profile on a company-owned device, Knox Manage now supports Knox policies. To add policies to a profile: For detailed information about each of the look up items, see List of lookup items. 1. Navigate to Profile. 2. On the Profile page, click the name of the profile to configure policies for. 3. On the Profile Details page, click Modify Policy. 4. Configure the policy details by device platform. Each device platform has different groups of policies. 1. Select the platform to configure, for example, Samsung Knox. 2. Find the setting you want to configure by selecting the proper category or by performing a keyword search in the Search Policy field. 3. Configure the policy as needed. 5. Save the policy: Click Save & Assign to save your changes and proceed to assigning the profile to groups or organizations. Click Save to save your changes. 6.

Android policy details #Freeze periods When applying system updates to devices running Android 9 and higher, IT admins can now use the Freeze Period option to delay deployment of system update to target devices. The following are important points to consider: Support for all update policies - The Freeze Period option supports many update policies such as automatic, postpone, and windowed. Freeze periods apply one at a time - Currently, IT admins cannot set up freeze periods that overlap each other. IT admins can set up multiple freeze periods but only one freeze period applies to devices at one time. Freeze period duration - IT admins can add a total freeze period of 90 days. Multiple freeze periods - Two freeze periods cannot overlap each other and must remain separated by a minimum of 60 days. Chrome OS policy details On Knox Manage, Chrome OS organizations, users, and devices sync with the Google Admin console. By default, a Chrome OS policy on the Knox Manage console is unset and greyed out, because it inherits the setting from either a parent organization or the Google Admin console. When you apply a policy setting on the Knox Manage console, you are in fact overriding it. Within an enterprise, organizations have parent-child relationships with each other. If an organization has no parent, unset policies show as Inherit from Google Default, which reflects that the original policy values come from the Google Admin console. If an organization is a child of another organization, its unset policies show as Inherit from _parent organization_, which reflects that the original policy values come from its parent. If a child organization has children, its policy overrides cascade down to its children. In order to set a policy, you must first deactivate its inheritance by selecting Locally applied from the drop-down next to it:",

For shared iOS devices, enterprises often separate device and user settings into different Knox Manage profiles. A policy's scope is determined by its _policy channel_, which can be: Device channel - The policy applies to the entire device and to temporary sessions. User channel - The policy applies to the user for the duration of their session. Each user can have different policies. Typically, Knox Manage profiles that use these policies are assigned to user groups rather than device groups. Common - The policy can apply through either channel.

Set the data collection interval and accuracy mode. Report device location interval - Set the interval at which location data should be collected from the user's device. For example, if you set the interval to 30 minutes, location data is collected from the device every 30 minutes after a profile is applied to the device. High Accuracy Mode - Enable this mode to improve the accuracy of collected location data. When you enabled this mode, locations are detected using GPS and Wi-Fi and mobile networks. When you disable it, the locating method that the user has specified on the device is used instead.

Knox Manage can integrate with the Microsoft Graph API for the purposes of connecting your Azure AD services to Knox Manage. This integration is powered by the cloud-based Knox Manage MDM app on the Azure portal. When configured and connected, the user and group information in your Azure tenant is made available to Knox Manage, similar to how sync services deliver directory data through the LDAP protocol. Syncing organizations isn't currently supported. In order to enroll Windows devices using methods based on Azure AD, consisting of Azure AD Registered, Azure AD Joined, Windows Out of Box Experience, and Windows Autopilot, you must connect your Knox Manage tenant to your Azure tenant through the Microsoft Graph API. For detailed information about these enrollment methods, see Enroll a Windows device with Entra ID. Only one Azure AD service is allowed per Knox Manage tenant, so you can't concurrently sync Azure AD through both the Microsoft Graph API and the LDAP protocol. Connect your Knox Manage tenant to Azure AD through Microsoft Graph API , Follow this procedure only if you are integrating the Azure AD service through the cloud-based app after the Knox Manage 22.08 release. If you already integrated the Azure AD service through the on-premises app before the Knox Manage 22.08 release, skip to the Migrate Azure AD sync through an on-premises app to a cloud-based app section instead. To connect Knox Manage with Azure AD through the Microsoft Graph API: 1. On the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory > Mobility (MDM and MAM) > Add Application. The Add an application page opens. 2. Find and click Samsung Knox Manage. 3. Click Add to confirm. The app appears in the list of apps back on the Mobility (MDM and MAM) page. 4. Go to the Overview page. 5. In the Basic information section, copy your Tenant ID. 6. On the Knox Manage console, go to Advanced > Azure AD Integration. 7. Paste your Azure tenant ID into the Directory ID field. 8. Click Verify. After a few moments, your Azure AD information shows at the top of the page. 9. Click Add for Sync Service Setting at the bottom of the page. 10. Click Save and Sync after linking the Microsoft Graph API as a sync service. Migrate Azure AD sync through an on-premises app to a cloud-based app Prior to Knox Manage 22.08, released on August 17, 2022, the Azure AD integration with Knox Manage was accomplished using an on-premises technology stack. This older method of integration is no longer supported. If you connected your Azure tenant to your Knox Manage tenant prior to Knox Manage 22.08, you must migrate to the cloud-based integration to continue syncing your Active Directory information. To migrate to Azure AD Integration from an on-premises app to a cloud-based app: 1. On the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory > Mobility (MDM and MAM) > Add Application. The Add an application page opens. 2. Find and click Samsung Knox Manage. 3. Click Add to confirm. The app appears in the list of apps back on the Mobility (MDM and MAM) page. 4.

            "content": "Integration with Knox MSP Program. Managed service providers (MSPs) can deliver and administer Knox Manage to their B2B customers with Knox MSP Program. Knox Manage is available within the same ecosystem as other Knox cloud services available to MSPs, such as Knox Configure and Knox Mobile Enrollment. As Knox Manage operates independently of the Knox Admin Portal and Knox MSP Portal, users are stored and managed through the unified Knox cloud user services rather than Knox Manage itself. The following Knox Manage functionality is available from within MSP: Add a Knox Manage customer - The MSP can add a new Knox Manage customer on the Knox MSP Portal. When adding a new customer, the MSP can provide all necessary and mandatory information on behalf of Knox Manage, such as customer ID, organizational information, and any other information needed to onboard the customer. By default, when adding a new customer, the customer's access permissions are set to No access, meaning the customer can't access the Knox Manage console, and their tenant is fully managed by the MSP. The MSP can change this permission to Full access, meaning the customer can access the Knox Manage console and their tenant is jointly managed by the MSP. Knox Manage SSO support - The Knox MSP Portal shares identify provisioning with the administered Knox Manage tenant, meaning the MSP and joined customers can access the Knox Manage console with the same single sign-on credentials they use to access the portal. To access the Knox Manage console from the portal, go to Customers, then click Active in the customer's entry in the list. Change customer management type - The MSP can also change all access permissions for the Knox Manage customer from within the Knox MSP Portal, with the exception of downgrading Jointly managed customer to Fully managed customer. After their access permissions are modified, the customer receives a notification by email with details about the change, as well information about how to register for the Knox MSP Portal. Delink MSP - The MSP can submit a request to revoke their own access to the Knox Manage tenant, known as a _delink MSP request_. Once the customer accepts the request, the MSP's access to the tenant is revoked, and sole control is restored to the customer. Migrate standalone Knox Manage tenants - The MSP can migrate existing Knox Manage tenants to the Knox MSP Program. If the customer hasn't already completed the registration of their tenant before the MSP migrates them, then the MSP must create a tenant on their behalf. When creating a new tenant, the MSP must be sure to submit a new tenant ID not already in use by the customer or their affiliate enterprises. If the MSP can't migrate a customer due to duplicate admin IDs, see MSPs cannot migrate Knox Manage customers who have an existing Knox Manage tenant in the Knox MSP Program documentation. Shared Knox Manage notifications - Any notifications configured in the customer's Knox Manage tenant are delivered to the Knox MSP Portal, including but not limited to expired licenses, new administrators, and certificate notices. To view these notifications on the Knox MSP Portal, go to Dashboard. View license consumption - The MSP can view license consumption information for Knox Manage, such as: Purchased licenses , Remaining licenses , Breakdown between Knox Manage and Knox Suite licenses , License key information",

Knox Manage (KM) lets you manage your fleet of Android devices and their apps through the Android Management API, which is the successor to the Google Play EMM API that first enabled Android Enterprise. Unlike with the previous EMM Android Enterprise, the Android Management API doesn't require the device to install a proprietary UEM agent such as the Knox Manage agent. Instead, the Android Device Policy app provides policy controller duties, unifying the policy deployment process across UEM solutions. The Knox Manage integration of the Android Management API is planned to offer the same features and serve the same use cases of Android device management as previous APIs. Knox Manage 22.03 and higher supports the Android Management API for the following deployment parameters: Personally-owned and company-owned devices with Work Profiles, QR code enrollment Enroll a device with Android Management API This section covers how to enroll an Android device with a Work Profile. It is the same process as described in Enroll a single device, but additional details are provided here. First, as the admin, you must prepare the enrollment: 1. Factory reset and power off the device. 2. On the Knox Manage console, go to User. 3. Select the user, then click Request Enrollment. An enrollment email with the QR code is sent to the user. Next, the device user enrolls the device: 1. Power on the device. 2. At the welcome screen, tap the screen six times. The QR code reader app automatically installs and launches. 3. Using another device to display the enrollment email, scan the QR code with the device. 4. On the Agree to Terms and Conditions screen, read and acknowledge the terms and conditions.

Unlike with Android devices, Knox Manage does not directly interact with Chromebooks through an agent on the Chromebook itself. Knox Manage instead interfaces with the Google Admin console, which does the intermediary work of enrolling a Chromebook and setting its policies. Communication between Chromebooks and the Google Admin console is enabled by native technologies on Chrome OS. Chrome OS management overview Chrome OS and Chromebook management on Knox Manage relies on a link between the managed services on the Google Admin console and the Knox Manage console. Due to this fact, there are some important differences you should keep in mind when managing Chrome OS and Chromebooks compared to the other supported OSs on Knox Manage: Automatic syncing - Organizations, users, and devices are synced from the Google Admin console. You cannot create new organizations or users from the Knox Manage console. Organization-based deployment - Devices can only be assigned to organizations. Groups are not supported. Organization-based profiles - Each organization has an automatically-generated profile associated with it. To set policies for deployments, you must edit the associated profile. You cannot create additional profiles. User-based enrollment - Each user account is associated with a Chromebook. Currently, the User & Browser and App & Extension policies are available. Support for Device policies is planned for a future release. Set up Chromebook management Before you can begin managing Chromebooks, you must set up your Google Admin Console and Knox Manage: 1. First, you need to upgrade your Chrome license. Depending on which license you have, purchase the Chrome Enterprise Upgrade or Chrome Education Upgrade from the Google Admin Console. 2. Once upgraded, you need to set up an organization and users. On the Google Admin console, create an organization and add your users. 3. Lastly, register the Google admin account with Knox Manage: 1. On the Knox Manage console, go to Setting > Chrome OS > Sign in with Google. The Google accounts page opens. 2. Sign in to the Google account. 3. Select all permissions, then click Continue. The browser returns you to the Knox Manage console. The Google Authorization Code field is now filled in. 4. Enter the same account for the Google Admin Email Address, then click Authorize.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Manage shared iPads. Knox Manage supports Shared iPad, which is a mode for iOS devices that allows different users to sign in to one iPad and receive a personalized experience with iPad features and their apps and files. Device users can either sign in with their Managed Apple ID and enjoy persistent apps and files, or start a temporary session, which is a guest mode that deletes all user data after the session ends. Shared iPads are enrolled and provisioned through Apple Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) profiles. An individual policy on a Shared iPad either applies to the entire device (through the device profile) or to the user account (through the user profile) for the duration of the shared user's session. For more details on how policies apply, see Configure Shared iPad policies. Supported devices For Shared iPad mode, Knox Manage currently supports the following devices: iPad (5th generation) and late, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 and late, iPad mini 4 and later, with the following minimum requirements: 32 GB storage , iOS 13.4 or higher , Deployed by ADE and in Supervised mode Deploy Shared iPads Registering and syncing Shared iPads is very similar to setting up devices using Automated Device Enrollment. For establishing device-wide policies, a staging user is assigned to the Share iPad through the ADE configuration. The device-wide profile and apps are configured and assigned to this staging user. For establishing user-level policies, Apple Business Manager syncs your actual users' Managed Apple IDs to Knox Manage. Once they are synced and you have corresponding Knox Manage users, you can then assign profiles with policies to them. As soon as you register an iPad through Apple Business Manager, it immediately enters the staging state and applies the assigned ADE profile. Therefore, it is crucial that you carefully configure your default ADE profile in advance, and take into account common policies and apps that need to apply to all users. To deploy Shared iPads with Knox Manage: 1. If you haven't already, create an Apple Business Manager account. 2. Factory reset all your iPads intended for Shared iPad mode. 3. Register a Managed Apple ID for each user through Apple Business Manager. 4. Configure a default ADE profile on the Knox Manage console. 5. Configure each device user and associate a profile with them on the Knox Manage console. 6. Sync the iPads with Knox Manage. Add and manage Shared iPad users Just like with other devices managed through ADE, you can map devices users to Managed Apple IDs manually or sync them through AD/LDAP. To manually sync a Managed Apple ID with a Knox Manage user, when you create the user account on the Knox Manage console, fill the Managed Apple ID field: When you sync Managed Apple IDs to Knox Manage users through AD/LDAP, on the Advanced > AD/LDAP Sync > Sync Service page, under Mapping Information, you can see the Managed Apple ID field synced from Apple Business Manager: View the status of a Shared iPad on the Knox Manage console On the Knox Manage console, you can view and specify the management mode of iOS devices on the Device Enrollment > Apple ADE > ADE Device Management page. To assign the device profile to a Shared iPad, select it and click Assign User. On the Device page, you can filter for Shared iPads by selecting Shared as the management type. When you hover over the Platform & Management Type of a device, a tooltip shows the current user's Managed Apple ID. Shared iPads receive a Shared Device tab on the Device Details page. On this tab, you can track the following information about the shared sessions of the iPad: Shared Device User tab - View all user sessions and temporary sessions on this iPad, and manually sync the session status of the iPad. Click Detail next to a user to open the Shared Device Details page, which displays information about the user and their sessions on this iPad. Shared Device Log tab - View the complete history of all sharing events on this iPad. On the Shared Device Details page, you can view information related to the user's session status, profile policies, group and organization, and device command history while they were using the iPad: Send device commands Like regular managed iPhones and iPads, you can send device commands to Shared iPads to control device behavior and retrieve information about it and its current status. For certain commands, the device must have an active user session with the Knox Manage agent running. You can send commands to one device at a time. For details about which commands require the agent, see iOS device commands. To send a device command during a staging user session, use the standard method on the Knox Manage console. To send a device command during a Managed Apple ID user session: 1. On the Device page, click the name of a Shared iPad. The details page for that iPad opens. 2. Click the Shared Device tab. 3. Click Device Command, then select a command to send. Configure Shared iPad policies For devices in Shared iPad mode, some policy settings are global in that they apply to the both the device and the current user at the same time, while others are exclusive to either the whole iPad or the user. With Shared iPads, a policy's scope is determined by its _policy channel_: Policy channel scope Device channel policy groups (staging user) User channel policy groups (users) Common System, Interface, Security, Application, Phone, Share, Browser, iCloud, Media By channel Wi-Fi, VPN, Certificate, Cellular, AirPRint, Font, App Lock, Global http proxy, Air Play, Web Content Filter, Network Usage Rules Exchange, Web Clip, Managed Domains The order of precedence for common policies is as follows: If the device profile configures a common policy, then its settings remain applied when the device user starts their session. If both the device profile and user profile configure the same common policy, then the group/organization policy settings apply when the device user starts their session. For the list of policies by channel, see iOS policies. Assign apps to Shared iPads For Shared iPads, managed apps can be assigned through the Volume Purchase Program (VPP), or by the staging user that the device profile is associated with. Managed apps on Shared iPads have some restrictions: Device users can only install internal and VPP apps from the Knox Manage agent. They can't download apps from the public App Store. Apps install between the staging state and user sessions. When a user is signed in, no apps can install. Knox Manage agent on Shared iPads The Knox Manage agent is supported on Shared iPads. This optional EMM app offers the following benefits: Device users can manually install internal and VPP apps as needed, without your needing to install them through a device command. Send device commands, including for sending push notifications and retrieving the device's location. The Knox Manage profile for your Shared iPads can apply based on the Day & Time profile event. During a shared user session, the user's Knox Manage identity is passed to the agent, signing them in automatically and providing them access to the app store in the agent's interface. On the device user's first shared session while the Knox Manage agent is running, they are prompted to read and agree to the agent's Privacy Policy. The agreement is tied to the installation, so if the agent is reinstalled at a later date, they will be prompted to agree to the policy again. #Deploy the Knox Manage agent To deploy the Knox Manage agent to Shared iPads in your tenant: 1. Begin following the instructions in Manage VPP applications to add and assign the agent as a VPP app. 2. When assigning the agent to your users, set the Assignment Type to Device, and Install Type to Automatic. If set to manual installation, the app can't be deployed to the Shared iPad. 3. Finish adding and assigning the app.",

Knox Manage implements User Enrollment by mapping a user's Managed Apple ID from your Apple Business Manager to their EMM user account in your Knox Manage tenant. When the personally-owned device then requests enrollment, Knox Manage is able to enroll it on behalf of your organization. Supported devices You can enroll the following personally-owned devices: iPhones running iOS 13 through 15, iPads running iPadOS 13 through 15 Supported management features Personally-owned iOS devices are subject the following conditions and limitations in Knox Manage: They can have Apple Volume Purchase Program apps assigned to them. They support the online sign-in and QR code enrollment methods. The sign-in method requires entering a long URL, so the QR method is more convenient for users. Knox Manage can't collect any identifying information about the device, such as its IMEI, serial number, phone number, and network information. The device name format is the user's Managed Apple ID, followed by iOS, followed by the serialized personal device number in your tenant (not the Apple serial number). For example: alex@appleid.example.com_iOS_27 , They support a subset of the total iOS policies and device commands. To see which are compatible, check the Supported system column in the iOS policy and iOS device command references.

In this section, you'll learn how to enroll, configure, and manage Wear OS devices (Galaxy Watch4 and later smartwatches) using the Knox Manage console. If you are using Tizen OS devices (Samsung Galaxy Watch3 or older), you can enroll and manage your smartwatches using the Knox Configure console. Please see Knox Configure for Wearables for more information. Before you begin In order to proceed, you'll need the following: #Device requirements 1. One or more Samsung Galaxy Watch4 (or later) series smartwatches running Wear OS 4.0 and higher. To check the software version on your smartwatch, go to Settings > About watch > Software info > Software version. 2. A Samsung Galaxy phone running Android 11 or higher (factory reset recommended). Note that Samsung Galaxy phones running the legacy \"One UI Core\" platform are NOT supported. See Samsung devices with legacy One UI Core for a complete list of unsupported devices. #Knox Manage requirements 1. A valid Knox Manage license with available seats for your Wear OS devices. See Knox Manage: View your license information for more information. 2. A properly configured Android Enterprise environment. You can confirm this by going to Setting > Android > Android Enterprise. You should see Knox Manage EMM registration information. If you see a Register EMM button instead, then you'll need to complete your configuration. Please review Configure the Android Enterprise environment for more information. Smartwatch modes explained Before jumping into the device enrollment and management procedures, it may be helpful to first understand the different modes in which Wear OS smartwatches operate. #Companion mode This is the default mode for consumers who purchase the Wear OS devices for personal use. When a user connects to the watch through Bluetooth, the Galaxy Wearable app provides a wizard to help guide the user through the setup process. Once set up, the watch will operate in Companion mode (one watch to one phone at a time) and will not have any support for enterprise provisioning or enrollment. #Pair and Detach mode When enterprise organizations purchase and distribute Wear OS devices for business purposes, they set up their enterprise smartwatches in Pair and Detach mode. This mode involves an IT admin using a single Samsung Galaxy phone running the Galaxy Wearable Manager for Enterprise app to set up multiple watches. Once the watches are set up by the IT admin, they are automatically detached from the phone, meaning they will only operate as standalone devices without a phone. Watches that are set up in this mode are managed and configured through Samsung Knox Manage. Once a Wear OS device is set up in either Companion or Pair and Detach mode, it will remain in that mode unless a factory reset is performed on the watch. Confirm successful device enrollment After you confirm successful Wear OS device enrollment, you should verify that Knox Manage is able to configure the watch. You can quickly check this by applying a policy or sending a device command. #Apply a policy change on the watch 1. On the Knox Manage console, go to Profile, then click Add. 2. On the Add Profile page, give your profile a name and select Wear OS from the Platform options, then click Save and Set Policy. 3. On the Set Policy page, select a policy for testing. For example, setting Factory Reset to Disallow would block the user from factory resetting the smartwatch. See Wear OS policies for the list of available Wear OS policies. 4. Click Save & Assign, then select your Wear OS device group. Knox Manage pushes the profile to every smartwatch in the group. 5. Back on the smartwatch, confirm the policy changes took effect. For example, confirm that the watch is unable to perform a factory reset if you configured that policy. #Send a device command to the watch 1. On the Knox Manage console, go to Group, then select your Wear OS device group from the list. 2. Click Device Command, then select Wear OS from the dropdown. 3. Select the device command that you want to send (for example, Device > Reboot Device), then click OK. See Wear OS device commands for the list of available Wear OS device commands. 4. Back on the smartwatch, confirm the device command got sent successfully. For example, confirm that the watch rebooted if you sent the Reboot Device command.",

            "content": "Non-shared Android device enrollment quickstart. Knox Manage has a special method of preparing an Android device, called _non-shared_. You can consider it as a special enrollment method that's unique to fully managed devices. The purpose of non-shared mode is to configure and enroll the device with a staging user, like a shared device, and then seamlessly transfer it to the actual user by transforming it into a fully managed device. Once the transformation takes place, the device can't be reverted to its non-shared state. Because the majority of the configuration and enrollment activities take place when the device is in the admin's possession, this new method minimizes disruption of the device user in demanding on-premises environments where they aren't equipped, capable, or free to enroll the device on their own. It also offers a way to standardize device devices. During setup, a non-shared device is like a typical shared device intended for a single business purpose, except it's destined to be operated by only one user. Like shared devices, a non-shared device receives a basic configuration and a staging user for testing and administration, and applies a profile payload when an assigned user account authenticates. You can pre-load content and pre-install apps to the device, so long as you assign them to the group of the user account intended for enrollment. Supported devices You can set up devices running Android 9 or higher in non-shared mode. Supported management features Non-shared devices are subject to the following limitations in Knox Manage: They can be enrolled with the token, QR code, Knox Mobile Enrollment, and Zero-touch enrollment methods. They support a subset of the total Android device commands. To see which are compatible, check the Supported system column in the Android Enterprise device command reference. Set up a non-shared Android device The process to set up a non-shared device has the following stages: 1. Register a staging user 2. Configure the staging user settings 3. Prepare apps and content for the device 4. Enroll the device 5. Provision the device #1. Register a staging user A non-shared device must be enrolled and set up with a _staging user_ before it's deployed. The staging user is an account with a supervisory scope that carries the basic device configuration and settings prior to provisioning the destination user. To create a staging user: 1. Go to User, then click Add. 2. Fill in the basic and required user account information. For more detailed instructions, see Register a single user account. 3. Set Staging user to Yes. 4. Set Using Type to Non-shared Device. 5. Save and confirm. #2. Configure the staging user settings Next, configure the device settings for the staging user: 1. Go to Setting > Configuration > Staging Device. 2. Click !add to add a unique configuration for the staging user. 3. As needed, set Utilities Setting to Allow and select which Android features to enable for the staging user: Powe , System Status Ba , Notification Ba , Key Guard 4. As needed, under Device Setting, select the items that the staging user can access in the Settings app on the device: Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , NFC , Mobile Data , Mobile Networks , Hotspot , Location 5. As needed, turn on Wi-Fi and preconfigure an access point that the device can connect to while in the staging state. 6. Click Select Staging User and select the staging user from the list. 7. Click Save & Apply to finish configuring the staging user settings. #3. Prepare apps and content for the device Next, pre-install the apps and content for the device. You can take two approaches to accomplish this: Add the staging user and destination user accounts to the same group, then assign the apps and content to that group. This approach speeds up enrollment by downloading all the apps and content to the device before it's deployed. Assign the apps and content to individual destination users. This approach offers more flexibility and user-based customization, but results in slower enrollment as the device must download all content and apps once it's in the user's possession. To prepare the apps and content for the non-shared device: 1. (Optional) Add the staging user and destination users to the same user group. 2. Assign the required apps to the group or individual destination users. 3. Assign the required content to the group or individual destination users. #4. Enroll the device Lastly, after preparing the staging user, apps, and content, you can enroll the device: 1. Enroll the device. For instructions about enrolling a single device with the available methods, see Enroll a single device. 2. After enrollment, go to Device, then search for and find the device. Verify that its value in the Platform & Management Type column is Non-shared Device. Its device name is the name you chose during enrollment, with the staging user name prepended. 3. Depending on how many apps and how much content you assigned to the staging user, it takes 5 - 10 minutes to prepare the staging device. During enrollment, ensure the device is connected to the internet for at least that length of time. After this period, you have two methods to verify that all the apps and content installed to the device: To verify that the apps installed, on the Knox Manage console, go to Device, then click the device's name. On the Device Detail page, open the Application tab, then the Assigned Application tab. In the app list, if the app installed successfully, its Install Status will be Installed. To verify that the content synced, on the device, open the Knox Manage agent, then go to Setting and tap Exit Non-shared mode. Keep in mind that this interrupts the enrollment flow, and should only be used for testing purposes. #5. Provision the device After the device is enrolled, it's ready for deployment and provisioning. The next step is to deploy the device to the destination user. After the device is provisioned, its name updates to reflect its new management mode. Once deployed, the device user must: 1. Power on the device. The Knox Manage agent prompts them to sign in. 2. (Optional) Tap !Download Download Configuration, then tap the Wi-Fi configuration you pre-configured for the device. The device connects to the access point. 3. Sign in with their Knox Manage account credentials. 4. If they agree to the Privacy Policy, select I agree and tap Next. Once the device user signs in, the device enters fully managed mode and permanently removes the staging user. You can verify that it provisioned correctly on the Knox Manage console: Go to Device, then search for and find the device. Its Platform & Management Type should now be Fully Managed, and Its user and device name should be updated to reflect the provisioned user. See also , Shared Android device quickstart",

            "content": "Shared android device quickstart. Normally, Android devices only support one user account, and don't provide a sign-in system. However, there are many cases in an enterprise's activities where a device would be more fit for purpose if it could support multiple identities, such as a device that's transferred to a different employee during each work shift, a freely-accessible device in a common room, or a shared device for visitors and guests. Knox Manage allows you to enroll Android devices in a special _shared_ mode, which supports the authentication of multiple assigned users through the sign-in screen on the Knox Manage agent. You can configure a shared device so that when a user signs in, it applies settings and a profile that is either generic or unique to that user, allowing varying levels of user access and permissions depending on the user's role and needs. To better isolate data between user accounts on the device, there are two _types_ of shared device: Shared device type Purpose Temporary For guests and visitors. Data and installed apps on the device are deleted when the device user signs out, meaning no locally stored information is shared between users or between sessions. Persistent For shift workers. Data and installed apps on the device are retained when the device user signs out, meaning locally stored information is shared between users and between sessions. Supported devices The following devices can be enrolled in shared mode: Samsung Galaxy Tab devices running Android 9 or higher, Non-Samsung devices running Android 9 or higher Set up a shared Android device The process to set up a shared device has the following stages: 1. Create a staging user 2. Configure the staging user settings 3. Enroll the device #Register a staging user Since Android can't operate without at least one active user, shared devices require a _staging user_ between regular user sessions. The staging user is an account with a supervisory scope that carries the basic device configuration and settings, and hosts a base session in the operating system that provides the sign-in screen to device users. When a device is being prepared to enter shared mode, it must be provisioned with the staging user. To create a staging user: 1. Go to User, then click Add. 2. Fill in the basic and required user account information. For more detailed instructions, see Register a single user. 3. Set Staging user to Yes. 4. Make sure Using Type is set to Shared Device. 5. Set Shared device type to Temporary or Persistent according to your deployment needs. 6. Click Save and confirm. #Configure the staging user settings Next, configure the device settings for the staging user that apply between regular user sessions. You can configure generic settings that apply to all staging users in your tenant, or create more specific configurations that only apply to select staging users. If you configure both, a specific configuration overrides the generic settings. To configure the staging user settings: 1. Go to Setting > Configuration > Staging Device 2. Next, choose whether you want the configuration to be generic to all staging users on the Default tab, or click !add to add a unique configuration for your shared device. 3. As needed, set Utilities Setting to Allow and select which Android features to enable for the staging user: Power , System Status Bar , Notification Bar , Key Guard 4. As needed, under Device Setting, select the items that the staging user can access in the Settings app on the device: Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , NFC , Mobile Data , Mobile Networks , Hotspot , Location 5. As needed, turn on Wi-Fi and preconfigure an access point that the device can connect to during staging user sessions. 6. If you're creating a configuration that's specific to the staging user, click Select Staging User and select the staging user from the list. 7. Click Save & Apply to finish configuring the staging user settings. #Enroll the device Lastly, after configuring the staging user and its settings, you must enroll the device and activate shared mode: 1. Go to User, then take note of the staging user's ID. 2. Then, enroll the device with the staging user through one of these methods: afw#knoxmanage token , QR code , Knox Mobile Enrollment Regardless of the method you choose, make sure you enter the staging user ID, or the device won't enroll in shared mode. 3. After enrollment, go to Device, then search for and find the device. If it successfully enrolled as a shared device, its value in the Platform & Management Type column is Shared followed by the type ( Temporary or Persistent ). Device user sign-in When the shared device is enrolled and deployed to the field, it displays the sign-in screen when no user session is active. A user starts a session by signing in with their Knox Manage account credentials. Samsung devices used as shared devices are automatically activated when a user first signs-in to it. For non-Samsung devices, the device user must activate the device by manually running the Knox Manage agent when they first sign in to the device. The device user can launch the Knox Manage app or tap the Knox Manage notification to run the agent. When the device user has finished their activities, they can end their session by tapping Check Out in the persistent Knox notification. If it's a temporary shared device, the app and user data on the device is erased. On shared devices of type persistent, the apps common to the staging users and device users are cached and available to device users when they sign in. Apps specific to a user are automatically downloaded and installed when the device user signs in to the shared device. Depending on the make of a device, it may have a limit on the number of secondary users it supports. When a shared device reaches its maximum number of secondary user accounts, if another secondary user attempts to sign in, it blocks the sign-in attempt and warns them. Policies and device commands for shared devices Shared devices can receive device commands and policies that are compatible with work profiles. Policies designed for fully managed mode won't take effect. Exit shared mode In case of emergencies or issues with the shared device mode, the device user can run the Exit Shared Device Mode action on the device to exit shared mode. Once they submit the action, the device user enters a passcode issued to them by an admin. Use Knox Remote Support You can perform a remote support session on a shared device with Knox Remote Support, provided the Knox Remote Support agent is first installed on the device. In order for the agent to be functional and accessible, it must be: 1. Installed to the personal or primary profile of the device. 2. Accessed during a staging user session, not a temporary or persistent user session. To install the Knox Remote Support agent on a shared device, the staging user must: 1. Open the Knox Manage agent, then select Service Desk on the sign-in screen or in the navigation bar. 2. Select Download Remote Support app. The Knox Remote Support agent downloads and installs. Once installed, the agent launches and shows a remote support access code, indicating that it's ready for a remote session. See also , Non-shared Android device enrollment quickstart",

Exit Kiosk without unenrollment #By sending a device command For a device that is successfully communicating with the server, you can send a device command to exit Kiosk mode. Doing so enables the device to exit the Kiosk mode and be managed in the normal mode. To restore the device back to Kiosk mode, you must apply the profile again. For more information about sending a device command, see Send device commands to devices. #By sending an exit Kiosk code You can perform this procedure on all types of Kiosks - such as Single App, Multiple App, and Kiosk Browser - regardless of whether they're properly communicating with the server. This feature only applies to Kiosks created in v20.8 or later. ##To exit Kiosk mode 1. Provide an Exit Kiosk Code to the device user. You can get the code from Device Details > Security > Kiosk Mode Status > Exit Kiosk Mode. If the device is deleted from the Device List, to get the code, on the left hand navigation menu, go to Device > in the right button area, click Deleted Devices > in the list of devices that shows, search for the appropriate device. You can find the Exit Kiosk Code in the list of results. The Exit Kiosk Code is randomly regenerated after it's applied to the device to prevent it from being used again without authorization from an IT admin. 2. The user managing the Kiosk device must do the following: 1. Tap the ![](../assets/info-kiosk.png) icon. In the case of a Single App Kiosk, you'll need to tap the Home or Back button to show this icon. The icon disappears after 5 seconds of inactivity. 2. On the About Kiosk screen, tap Exit\"Kiosk. 3.

            "content": "Configure Kiosk mode for smartwatches. When Android devices like smartphones and tablets are engaged in Kiosk mode, the device user can visually distinguish the kiosk from a normal device. Typically, the kiosk would have some type of launcher, be restricted to either a single app, or limited to a small number of apps, and have some sort of background image set by Knox Manage. When it comes to Wear OS smartwatches, they too can enter Kiosk mode, however they look identical to a normal smartwatch, and present some notable differences in the user experience. When a smartwatch is engaged in Kiosk mode, the device user is limited to the apps and watch face set by Knox Manage. Certain menus like Quick Panel, Notification Panel, and Widgets and Tiles are disabled by default - but can be enabled through a policy update - while other menus like the Apps List and Watch Face Customization are disabled completely. Watch faces and Kiosk mode The watch face of a smartwatch is the entry point to the smartwatch user experience. All apps and functionality are accessed through the interface provided by this package. Because of this, there are serious constraints you should plan around when engaging a smartwatch in Kiosk mode. A smartwatch kiosk is restricted to the watch face set by Knox Manage. Therefore, the device's watch face must provide access to all apps you intend the device user to operate - if an app isn't included of the watch face's allowlist, it won't appear in the Apps List. Furthermore, the user won't be able to open or operate the app, even if the app was delivered by Knox Manage. A further complication is that if an app is hidden, it might not necessarily be disabled. A system app or first-party default app, such as Samsung Health, will continue to run in the background. A third-party app, even if it's a default app, is disabled unless the watch face allows it and it's controlled by Knox Manage. To avoid all issues surrounding access to apps in Kiosk mode, you must: Manage the watch face package as an app in your tenant. For more details about watch face packages, see About kiosk mode watch faces in the Samsung developer docs. Ensure that the watch face package you manage is imbued with the capability to run all desired apps. In the kiosk profile, configure the appropriate policies to allow all desired apps. See the next section for details. Configure and deploy a Wear OS kiosk Wear OS profiles don't support events. First, add the appropriately-configured watch face as a managed app: 1. Begin adding a Wear OS app. 2. For step 3, upload the watch face package. 3. Save the app. You don't need to assign the app to the Wear OS device group. Next, configure a kiosk profile for Wear OS and deploy it: 1. Go to Profile, then click Add. The Add Profile page opens. 2. Enter a unique Name for the kiosk profile. 3. For Platform, select Wear OS. 4. Click Save & Set Policy to proceed to the policy configuration page. 5. Expand the Kiosk policy drawer and set the following policies: Kiosk Settings - Apply , Kiosk Settings > Allowlisted App - Click Add and select each app that should be accessible on the smartwatch. 6. Expand the Application policy drawer and set the following policies: Watch Face Customization - Apply , Watch Face Customization > Package Name - Click Add and select the watch face app package that you added to the tenant. Watch Face Customization > Watch Face Change - Disallow 7. Click Save & Assign to register the profile and proceed to the Assign Profile page. 8. In the Target section, set Target Type to Group. 9. Search for and select the Wear OS device group, then click Assign. 10. When asked to confirm, verify the assignment details, then click OK. The kiosk configuration is saved and assigned to the chosen device group. If you need to add more apps, edit the profile, add them to the Kiosk Settings > Allowlisted App policy, then re-assign the profile. Unenroll a device or exit the kiosk mode In case of connectivity issues or for offline devices not connected to a network, device users can manually unenroll the device or exit the kiosk mode on a Wear OS device. To do so, device users must tap Offline Unenrollment or Exit Kiosk in the device settings and provide a nine-digit code to initiate device unenrollment or exit from the kiosk mode. #Pre-requisites for exiting kiosk mode You must add a direct link to the Knox Manage agent on the kiosk device, using one of the following methods: Device users must remap the double-press action on the device's Home key to the Knox Manage agent. To do so, go to Settings > Advanced features > Customize keys > Home key Double press > Knox Manage. App developers must add a direct link to the Knox Manage agent in the kiosk app. To do so, use the following code in the kiosk app implementation: ```java val intent = Intent(\"com.sds.emm.cloud.knox.samsung.activity.EXIT_KIOSK\") intent.flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK context.startActivity(intent) ```",

Similar to other managed devices, you can configure policies, send commands, and deploy apps to a kiosk. Knox Manage 23.03 and higher supports kiosks on Android Enterprise's Android Management API (AMAPI) platform. For other supported platforms, see About kiosk mode. Consider the following while creating AMAPI kiosks: Like with the Android Enterprise platform, AMAPI kiosks support both Single-app and Multi-app modes. The apps are managed only through Managed Google Play. Limited customization options are available for the kiosk interface. You can disable only a few UI elements, such as the status and navigation bars. The Kiosk Wizard isn't available for creating AMAPI kiosk profiles. You can't customize home screen elements, such as app shortcuts, folders, widgets, the favorite apps, and the wallpaper. Creating kiosks from Android Management API profiles In Single-app mode, AMAPI kiosks run a single app that device users can't close. In multi-app mode, the kiosk runs a specific set of apps that you specify. To create an AMAPI kiosk: 1. Create a profile for the Android Enterprise, Android Management API platform. 2. For the created profile, set a policy that specifies the apps available on the kiosk. 3. Assign and apply the profile to a target group or organization.

As part of its base EMM features, Knox Manage can deploy, monitor, and manage kiosks in your device fleet. When deploying a kiosk on any of the platforms that support the concept, the device enters _kiosk mode_, which is a collection of operating system features and behaviors that provide a kiosk experience to the user. The specific features available vary depending on the platform. The basic idea of kiosk mode is to take the base operating system on the device, limit its non-essential functionality, and provision it in a certain way so that the user experience is ephemeral and constrained to the kiosk's intended use-case. Supported platforms Knox Manage supports kiosks on the following platforms: Android Enterprise, Windows 10/11, iOS through App Lock, Chrome OS Like standard managed devices, you can configure policies, send commands, and deploy apps to the kiosk.",

Windows kiosks are split between two types - single-app and multi-app. Single-app kiosks continuously run one app in full screen, while multi-app kiosks offer a selection of apps that the device user can choose from. Here's a detailed feature breakdown between the two: Single-app Windows kiosk Multi-app Windows kiosk Supported platforms Windows 10/11 Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education Non-admin account Supported app types Microsoft Edge 1 or Kiosk Browse Microsoft Store (UWP) apps Kiosk Browse Microsoft Store (UWP) apps Win32 apps User entry point Session welcome screen App grid User interface Single web browser or app Desktop with taskbar Login Automatic Automatic Access to Downloads directory No Yes 1 Requires Windows 10 version 1809 or higher.

Microsoft Edge Browser with two InPrivate browsing modes available: Public Browsing Mode - An unrestricted browsing mode where most web browser features are available. The user can end the session, which clears the browsing data. Digital/Interactive Signage Mode - A non-browsing mode limited to one web page where the user can't exit the session. 2.

Please refer to the below list of new features and improvements to be released with Knox Manage version 2.1.4 scheduled for Sunday, September 30, 2018. Mobile content management (MCM) support This is a significant enhancement that many customers waited for. From this release, IT admins can remotely upload and distribute files to selective targets per Organization/User/Devices, or to all levels. The size of each content should be less than 100 MB. Console-wise, KM does not limit the total uploading capacity. Most of the major productivity, image, video file types are supported: Productivity - DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, GUL, HWP, PDF, RTF, WKS, WPD, TXT, Image - BMP, GIF, JPEG, JPG, PNG, PSD, TIF, TIFF, ICO, Video - 3GP, AVI, MKV, MP4, MOV, MPG, MPEG, RM, SWF, WMV, WAV, MP3 Once deployed, end users can access files in the Content which is the menu in the KM agent. Native application for each content should be run for user to view the files. Click Content > Browse contents list > Select a proper viewer app > Read the content. As of infrastructure for MCM feature, Knox Manage will utilize CDN (Contents Delivery Network) service of Akamai. The below diagram illustrates how it works. Find the offline unenrollment code of deleted devices To date, offline unenrollment code is available so long as the device is available in the Knox Manage console. IT admins had to make sure to jot down the code before deleting; if deleted accidentally, it was impossible to find the code. From this release, IT admins can find Offline unenrollment code in Audit Logs even if the device has been deleted from the Knox Manage console. Dialer app support in multi-kiosk mode Dialer app has been added under the Utility Applications list in Kiosk Wizard components. IT admins can drag and drop Dialer app to the kiosk screen, and click the phone dialer icon to default set to automatically run the app. Configuration of kiosk settings To date, IT admins could either allow or disallow the entire access to the Device Settings of kiosk devices. Now, IT admins can configure which options from Device Settings to be available in kiosk devices. New Knox Manage console menu UX The Knox Manage console menu has been updated for better user experience.

If SIM lock option is enabled, IT admins should set the default SIM PIN and the new PIN. Default SIM PIN - IT admin should firstly check if SIM cards have default PIN set by operator. In that case, the already existing SIM PIN must be written. New SIM PIN - Write a 4- to 8-digit number as to unlock SIM card. This field can be used to change a PIN number as well. If device is SIM-locked, user must enter this PIN number to reuse the SIM card. When the device is unenrolled from KM, the SIM PIN number reverts back to its original one. Prohibit email registration within the Knox Workspace IT admin can prohibit end users from adding email accounts to the preloaded or Samsung email apps. If set to Disallow, then any email accounts cannot be registered. If set to Allow while domain allowlist is selected at the same time, only accounts of the allowed domain can be added. Open APIs for Samsung Electronics B2B Shop The below two open APIs are available for Samsung Electronics B2B shop. Tenant creation - The tenant is created and password is updated in initial login-in. Endpoint - /crs/oapi/tenant/createTenant , Add License - The license is registered to each matched tenant Endpoint - /crs/oapi/license/registerLicense Terminology changes Limited Enrollment (IMEI Management > Limited Enrollment) The IMEI management option has been renamed as Limited Enrollment. KM can now allow only the predefined devices be enrolled. IT admins can add devices by IMEI or Serial numbers, or in bulk using excel file. Device Status (Activated/Deactivated > Enrolled/Unenrolled) Device status \"Activated/Deactivated\" has been updated to \"Enrolled/ Unenrolled\" for clear messaging. The enrolled device icon and the text description is added in user/organization, administrators menu, etc. Miscellaneous enhancements , The cloud connector always applies when IT admin integrates AD/LDAP or registers CA. Customer does not have to choose whether to use or not. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use is shown in the Knox Manage console. Position & enroll method cannot be viewed from the User & Organization list. License buffer 10% is applied although customers cannot see any difference in the Knox Manage console. They can use 10% more license, if the number of licenses exceeds the limit.

            "content": "Knox Manage 2.1.5 release notes. Please refer to the below list of new features and improvements to be released with Knox Manage version 2.1.5 scheduled for Friday, November 23, 2018. Highlights , Android Enterprise Support, Getting Started UI/UX Update, Profile Access Management for Sub-admins, Remote Support Tool Enhancement (No 6-digit Code) Android Enterprise introduction Knox Manage 2.1.5 is the first version to support Android Enterprise. Most of the major features are supported from this release, yet some of the rest features are coming soon. Please refer to the Android Enterprise Support in the last part for more details. Getting Started UI/UX update Quick start wizard is replaced with Getting Started to maintain consistent Look & Feel with the other Knox cloud services such as Knox Configure. The tasks are listed based on the main scenario groups, Enroll, MDM, MAM, MCM and Setup. The \"Start\" buttons of each task will redirect IT admins to the dedicated menu links. In the later release, we will provide FAQs under the each task menu and additionally include advanced use cases such as AD/LDAP user integration or Cloud Connector. Profile access management of sub-admins Super admin can assign sub-admins with specific access to selected MDM/MAM profiles from the Administrators list in the Knox Manage console. Click profile setup icon after creating admin ( Setting > Admin Console > Administrators ) , Assign MDM/MAM profile accesses to each sub-admin Remote Support tool enhancement From this release, end users do not have to enter 6-digit code to receive remote support, if the user turned on \"Allow Admin to run\" option from the app (by tapping !icon.png the icon). If the setting is on, IT admin can remotely initiate Remote Support Tool without end user's consent. This enhancement has been made especially for transportation use cases, where the drivers had pull over their trucks to enter 6-digit code if were to receive support. Marketing name support Previously, Knox Manage console displayed the device list only by the model codes, such as SM-G955F and MN8X2KH. From this release, the device list will also show the marketing names along with the model codes for Samsung and Apple devices. For example, Galaxy S9 Plus (SM-G955F). Check a device's Last Seen (Connectivity) in the device list _Last connected_ term in the device list has been changed to _last seen_, which is the menu to show when was the last communication between the KM server and the device agent. The time is shown either in red or green arrows according to the predefined policy value at Based on Last Seen (time) under Setting > Configuration > Category : Device. The default is set at 24 hours; if the last connection was 24 hours ago, red arrows will appear. Create app shortcut on Home screen IT admin can create shortcut icon at Home screen when installing internal app by checking Create a Home screen shortcut during app installation option in application profile in Profiles > Application Management Profiles. Priority setup between device command and profile Even if policies are already applied, device command has higher priority than the profile policy. For example, even if power off option is disabled by MDM profile, IT admin can still reboot the device by executing the Reboot device command. Now there are three exceptions not following the above priority setting - Location profile, App-related profile, and Micro SD card factory reset - per reasonable scenarios as below. Location policy relates with Privacy issue. If end user did not agree with the sharing of location information, Admin should not be allowed to gather. If an app is blocked, the app cannot be installed; even if it were installed, the app would be automatically deleted instantly. Hence, the blocked app cannot be run through device command. In Micro SD card case as well, two conflicting policies will not work. For example, to send device command to factory reset and initialize SD card when the use of Micro SD card is disallowed in profile. Minor UI/UX updates KM agent session , When agent login credentials were changed, the KM agent would be automatically logged out from the existing session. From this release, the session will be kept (not logged out) even if IT admin changed end user's password to remedy the use case where many devices are enrolled to a single user ID. Alert shows two events by default , Only two critical events - Security Violation and Changes in Device Status, will Alert IT admin in the default setting. Un-enrollment by end use , End user can unenroll device by themselves without admin's command so long as Allow deactivation request is set allowed; the option is available under Application Profile > EMM Client on the Knox Manage console. Policy summary view on the device side , Admin can choose whether to show Policy summary in the KM agent or not from EMM Client Policy menu in Profiles \u00c3 Application Management Profile \u00c3 EMM Client Policy. Workspace creation option is deprecated, so the folder type is applied by default. Android Enterprise support The major features included with this release are: Managed Device (and enrollment by KME, Identifier, QR code), Work Profile (and enrollment by KME and generic registration), Managed Google Play Store (public/private app deployment) User interface search function improvements Currently, users may not know how the search function optimally works within the Knox Configure console. The console's search capabilities are case insensitive within most tables, but case sensitive in some tables, such as the Devices tab, since the vast number of devices require case sensitivity. A partial match search is supported for each search parameter, but an exact match is applied to a device IMEI/SN. Additionally, a blank space between search keywords means an AND condition The following are the tabs within the Knox Configure console, and the searchable columns or parameters within each. These will be better described in the Knox Configure User Guide beginning with this release: _Profiles_ - PROFILE, _Devices > UPLOADS_ - RESELLER, _Devices > DEVICES -_ DEVICE ID, PROFILE, MODEL, TAGS, _Devices > DEVICES Device deletion log -_ DEVICE ID, MODEL, ORDER NO. DELETER, _Licenses -_ LICENSE NAME, KEY, _Applications -_ Application name, Package name, Description, _Administrators -_ ADIMINISTRATOR NAME, EMAIL, _Activity log_, NAME, CATEGORY, EVENT, DESCRIPTION Knox Manage Android Enterprise support Google provides two modes of Android Enterprise, Managed Device and Work Profile. Managed Device is to manage CL (Corporate Liable) devices those owned by the enterprise. When device is enrolled as Managed Device, IT admin has the full control over the device; the agent sits as Device Owner (DO) of the device. Work Profile is BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) case, where end user owns the device and uses it both personally and for work. The agent sits inside the container area as Profile Owner to separate work apps from personal apps. IT admin can control the work area only, and has no visibility over personal area. Non-AE Android features, which we named as Android (Legacy) in the console, continue to be supported. When adding organizations or users, IT admin will select the activation type. Knox Manage V2.1.5 includes features of both Fully Managed Device and Work Profile. Major policies of Android Enterprise type are supported as below. EMM Registration for KM Android Enterprise Prior to utilize Android Enterprise services on Knox Manage, IT admin must register gmail account and EMM information with Google Server through Knox Manage by Google policy. KM provides Managed Google Play Account Sign-up for that in Settings \u00c3 Android \u00c3 Android Enterprise as the screenshot. Once clicked \"Register EMM\" button, IT admin will be redirected to the page to sign in to Google Play. Managed Google Play Store Managed Google Play Store is the enterprise version for Google Play Store which allows to select, purchase and manage apps for the organization. IT admin can create a list of approved apps and manage updates. Managed Google Play on Knox Manage supports deployment of both public and private apps. And there are two ways of providing private apps - Google hosted (application should be uploaded to the Managed Google Play) and Self-hosted (without uploading the internal app to Google server). Knox Manage V2.1.5 only provides Google hosted for now, and Self-hosted will be available from the next year.

The app will be available within 20 minutes. 3. Synchronize the application list by clicking Sync Google Managed Apps. Improved sub-admin management Super admins can now assign sub-admins permissions on a more granular level. Previously, sub-admin roles were managed by granting permissions to manage certain menus from the admin console, such as Apps, Certificate, Organizations, Policy Profiles or Audit. This release will allow super admins to manage sub-admins through specific profiles and/or organizations. Go to Settings > Admin Console > Administrators, and click the button that corresponds with the desired management role. The sub-admin can now have a profile management role, organization management role, or both. Sub-admins with both roles are given permission to assign and deploy profiles to a specific organization. Android Enterprise dedicated device (COSU) Dedicated devices (formerly called corporate-owned single-use, or COSU) are fully managed devices that serve a specific purpose (e.g. retail kiosk). Until this release, only Samsung devices supported Single App Kiosk mode. In addition to Samsung devices, IT admins can now set up Single App Kiosk for non-Samsung devices (requirement: Android P or above) with Android Enterprise mode. Go to Profiles > Device Management Profile > Android Enterprise > Policy > Kiosk, and select Single app. Runtime permission per application IT admins can now configure Runtime Permission settings for each application. Go to Profiles > Device Management Profile > Android Enterprise > Policy > Application, and select the option ( Prompt, Grant, Deny ) for App Permissions. IT admins can also configure exceptions for the permission, as demonstrated by the app permission settings for KakaoTalk below. Run applications automatically after installation When setting up Application Policies, IT admins can predefine whether or not to automatically run the application after installation. User Configuration Option for VPN/Wi-Fi/Email User information within the Knox Manage server can be used when configuring VPN/Wi-Fi/Email settings for the IT admins' convenience.

            "content": "Knox Manage 2.2.0 release notes. Please refer to the below list of new features and improvements to be released with Knox Manage version 2.2.0, scheduled for Thursday, March 28, 2019. Work profile on fully managed device (COMP), Mobile Admin, Device command for screen lock, Auto-execution of Remote Support to device, Kiosk Wizard enhancements UX improvements The Knox Manage Admin console UX will gradually be updated beginning from March until September. As a first step, this release includes improved UI/UX of buttons and pop-up windows as shown below. Buttons: New look and feel, Updated location of Save and Cancel buttons, Added Save Draft button Dialogs and popups: Background, font, and underline of the upper title, Background of lower action bar Work profile on fully managed device (previously known as COMP) There are two types of Android Enterprise enrollment for company-owned devices; one is _fully managed device_ and the other is _work profile on fully managed device_. Fully managed device enables IT admins to have full management over the device side (which is exclusively used for work purpose, DO). Work profile on fully managed device can control both the device and profile, COMP. Employee-owned devices can set up work profiles regardless of the enrollment type. One AE profile can have policies for both fully managed device (DO) and work profile (PO). Extended search period of audit log The maximum period for audit log search has been extended from one week to one month (30 days). Limited Enrollment settings location The Limited Enrollment settings can now be found under both Setting > Configuration and Setting > Android > Limited Enrollment. Modifications made on either one of the two sides will be reflected in both settings. Mobile version of Knox Manage console (Mobile Admin) Knox Manage now supports a mobile version of its console, called _Mobile Admin_. When accessing the admin console from mobile devices, the Go to Mobile Admin button will show up. Mobile Admin supports overall menus and features. IT admins can check the dashboard, user list and device list, and send device commands such as device lock/unlock from mobile. Sorting in KM app store End users can sort applications by registration time or name in the app store within the KM agent in legacy mode. The default list is sorted by registration, same as before the release. Release note pop-up notification After signing into the Knox Manage console, IT admins can see a summary pop-up notification about major enhancements from the recent release, as depicted in the below screenshot. New device command for screen lock Screen lock feature has been added. There are now two types of device lock commands. Lock Screen command can simply turn off the device screen. If the end user has not set a screen lock option, the display can be turned on again without password validation. If screen lock was set, the screen lock password should be entered to unlock. Lock Device command can lock the device. The password to unlock the device is managed by Knox Manage. The end user must ask the IT admin to unlock the device. EMM client lock in EMM category has been changed to Lock EMM Client to avoid confusion. Additional information shown on location dashboard Previously, only the mobile ID was shown on the device location dashboard. Additional mobile information such as IMEI, serial number and mobile number is now provided on the map, as shown below. Application execution count IT admins can check how many times apps were executed and the number of months. The count is reset to 0 after device factory reset, which means count per application persists regardless of uninstallation. The number of months means [current month - the month that app was installed +1]. Automatic configuration of Wi-Fi 802.1xEAP Wi-Fi 802.1xEAP (PEAP) setting can be pushed and automatically configured to the device without end user input. Until the release, there was a pop-up notification to set the password, which prohibited automatic configuration. Auto-execution of Remote Support on devices When initiating Remote Support from the KM console, IT admins can decide whether to require end user's consent (opt-in) or to automatically run (force mode). Kiosk Wizard UX enhancements and widget updates , Previously, Package name and Version were mandatory; now they will be automatically generated. When creating a multi-app kiosk, the initial package name will be automatically generated. If necessary, this can be updated before saving. Whenever modifications are made, the version number is increased automatically. A manual update is also available to allow, for example, updating from 1.2.8 to 2.0.0. Memo widget is removed from the Kiosk Wizard. Clock and Calendar widgets will provide localized language based on the device language setting. A total of six languages are supported - English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Deutsch and Italian. For unsupported languages such as Korean, the language will be set to English. Simplified Kiosk Wizard workflow If a Multi Kiosk application is added through the + button in Applications > Kiosk applications, the KM console provides a pop-up window to bridge the Device Profile and Kiosk application. Additionally, this provides a bridge to update the kiosk application on every target device right after updating Kiosk application. There is no need to push the update command through the Kiosk app list. Updated information icon in Knox Manage agent For better visibility, the information icon within Kiosk mode has been changed as depicted below; the icon is easier to distinguish against both light and dark backgrounds. Enhancement to Wi-Fi configurations on tablets Until this release, allowing the Wi-Fi setting within Kiosk mode would expose access to other setting options in tablet devices. The UI/UX has been improved to enhance security by hiding access to other setting options as shown below. Application Workflow Enhancement Application workflow design has been changed from Save & Assign during initial app registration to adding the app and/or assign/apply later. Miscellaneous enhancements , (Console) User ID (Device Enrollment) , User ID field for device enrollment is no longer case sensitive. The end user will not need to double check capital letters when entering their ID. (Console) Help Button when Adding Public Application , (Console) Page Numbering Enhancement at Kiosk Wizard , (Console) Simplified Group Lists in Reference Data , Due to under-utilization of the feature, Reference Data is minimized to hide all options except Position, Security Level and Site groups.(Agent) Auto-reassignment of Profile after Agent Update , Newly-released recent features can only run on the agent with the latest version. Previously, IT admin had to update KM agent to the latest version, and then re-assign profile policy again in order to implement newly-released features. To minimize inconvenience, profiles will be automatically re-configured on the device-side once the agent is updated to the latest version. This is limited to devices with agent 2.1.7 or above. For example, devices on which the agents were updated from 2.1.5 to 2.2.0 still require manual re-assignment. (Console) New Device command for attestation , IT admins can send a device command to check the attestation status of each device regardless of any pre-configured MDM profile configurations (the policy is available under Security > Attestation ). Previously, setting up this MDM policy to \"use\" was a pre-condition.

Highlights , Multi-app Kiosk Support for Android Enterprise Managed Device (DO), Forced Password Setup by Device Lock Task Mode Settings control within Samsung Keyboard A new policy to control Samsung Keyboard settings has been added under Device Management Profile > Android Enterprise or Android (Legacy) > System. If applied, clicking the settings icon within Samsung Keyboard will not trigger any activity. This policy is recommended to be set when controlling settings access, especially for kiosks. _Normal behavior with Samsung Keyboard_ _Policy applied behavior_ Forced password setup by device lock task mode Lock task mode will be activated if the end user does not set up a password policy even after a device screen lock policy has been applied. This means that the user cannot get out of locked task mode but can set a screen lock password in accordance with the policy requirement. Check the below pictures to see the password setup process in Lock task mode. Automatic app installation Prior to this release, Knox Manage provided two options for app installation - Mandatory (automatically installed app that cannot be deleted by end user) and Manual (manually downloadable app that can be deleted). Now one more option, Automatic, has been added; apps will be installed automatically and can be uninstalled by end user. If the end user deletes an app that was installed via the Automatic option, the app can be re-installed by applying the same profile again. Multi-app kiosk support for Android Enterprise managed device (DO) The support coverage of Multiple App kiosk mode has been expanded to Kiosk for fully managed device (DO devices with Android M/N/O OS) in Android Enterprise policy. Refer to the below table for the current availability of Knox Manage Kiosk modes. Mobile ID check from app download history Previously, app download history was based on user (in the event that a common ID is used, IT admin cannot distinguish who the end user is). After this release, IT Admins can check the download history of internal applications by mobile ID. BAS review configuration IT admin can choose whether to use BAS (Business App Store within KM agent) review or not. New version naming rule A new naming rule has been adopted for Knox Manage versions to better communicate with customers based on monthly releases. This release is named _Knox Manage 19.04_ as the version is to be released in April 19, 2019, also known as the 04 th month in 20 19. This will be shown on both console and agent sides. Wildcard support for Wi-Fi, Exchange, email configurations IT admin can set up Wi-Fi, Exchange, e-Mail easily with Knox Manage inside data through the wildcard. Knox Manage minimum supported OS version The minimum Android OS version has been changed to L OS (+ OS 5.0). From 19.4, KM-activated devices running lower versions than L OS (ex. OS 4.4) can maintain existing policies without issue. However, the agent cannot be updated and new features will not work on those devices. For new devices running lower versions than L OS, the KM team will provide a separate download link.

Please refer to the below list of new features and improvements to be released with Knox Manage version 19.05 scheduled for Thursday, May 30, 2019. Highlights , MCM Enhancement (Notification for contents download, Select areas to download), Updates to Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy, Kiosk Setting Enhancement - Display, Sound, Mobile Network for tablet devices. Notification for completing contents download After downloading each content file, the device notification will display file names individually. Select areas to download content IT admin can send files regardless of device activation type. IT admins can also select which area receives files. Android (Legacy) - General and/or Knox, Android Enterprise - Fully Managed Device and/or work profile Content uploaded before 19.05 is set as General in Android (Legacy) and Fully Managed Device in Android Enterprise. Download history in the content list has two additional columns, Android activation type and Deployment area. Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy update The Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy have been updated based on regional regulations. Knox Manage provides 3 variations based on the country setting - EU(GDPR), Global, or Korea. Bulk offline unenrollment Prior to 19.05, IT admins were able to bulk unenroll active devices by sending an unenrollment command, while offline unenrollment was done per device only. From 19.05, bulk offline unenrollment is available as well. This feature works only on devices activated with the same type. IMEI and serial number added to Device License report IMEI and Serial No. have been added to the Device License report query. Application update option Updated configurations for Managed Google Play applications have been added. Added support for 802.1xEAP security type Knox Manage now supports the 802.1xEAP security type under Wi-Fi settings in Android Enterprise. Enrollment type selection between DO and COMP Enrollment type selection UX/UI for AE modes has been changed. Kiosk mode setting updated for tablets IT admins are able to provide limited device settings, but options for tablet devices are limited due to Android's UI. For that reason, Knox Manage is enhancing device settings for Kiosk mode. In 19.05, Display and Sound have been updated. Kiosk clock widget provides 24-hour format IT admins can set up the clock widget in Kiosk in either the 12-hour or 24-hour format. Google Push support in Remote Support Google Push (FCM) is now used as the new default communication method between IT admin's Remote Support viewer and Remote Support agent at the device level instead of SMS messaging. This means you can now use Remote Support for Wi-Fi only tablet devices. The Remote Support agent and Viewer should be updated to 19.05 for FCM availability. If the user uses work profile (PO), then they must use SMS messaging, not Google Push, for Remote Support. The Remote Support and KM agents must be installed in the same area for Google Push communication, but in PO mode, the KM Agent stays in work profile as opposed to the Remote Support agent. Device Profile according to AER about work profile , Device password policy is now applied regardless of work profile. (From N OS and above) In COMP mode, a policy set in Fully Managed Device is also applied to the device. Remote Screen Lock is available on work profile. If an IT admin sends the Lock Screen command, the user is prompted to enter the password in accordance with the scenarios outlined below: If the user sets the same password for their device and work profile, the device will also be locked. If the device and work profile have different passwords, only the work profile will be locked. If a password is not set for both areas, the user is only able to unlock through the swipe action. USB debugging is controlled in work profile. IT admins can use that policy to prohibit USB debugging (ADB shell).

Please refer to the below list of new features and improvements to be released with Knox Manage version 19.09 scheduled for September 26, 2019 through September 30, 2019. Highlights , UI/UX design refreshment, Multi-profile support, Android zero-touch support, AD/LDAP group sync support, Android 10 updates Look and feel refreshment The UI/UX design of Knox Manage console been redesigned into Knox Suite style. This refreshment will allow IT admins with simplified workflows and deliver harmonized look and feel with other Knox Cloud services such as Knox Configure. App assignment workflow enhancements App management profile step has been removed to streamline steps to assign applications to groups and organizations. Now three clicks with connection points are all steps you have to do to assign apps. Multi-profile support With Multi-profile support, IT admins can assign more than one profile to groups and organizations and manage each by priority settings. The profile with the highest priority overrides the others when policy conflict occurs among multiple profiles. Simplified group management It was often hard for IT admins to understand and manage many different types of groups with different limitations. Now, there are only three groups (of user, device and AD/LDAP) where multiple MDM profiles or device commands can be executed regardless of types of the group. Relocation of keepalive and profile update scheduler settings Two types of Knox Manage agent policies, keepalive and profile update scheduler, have been moved to console's main Setting page. Also, IT admins can apply each setting globally or per group/organization. Profile assignment to AD/LDAP groups Previously, IT admins could not assign profiles to AD/LDAP groups directly; they had to firstly create organizations and move users to organization to assign profiles. With 19.09 improvements, IT admins can assign profile to AD/LDAP group. Transferring of entire folders in Remote Support Until the release, Remote Support supported transfer of file types only. With this release, Remote Support can move folder and every files inside that folder together. This improvement is especially useful for the IT admin to gather a whole bunch of device dump logs in the saved folder. Zero-touch support Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment is a crucial feature for B2B customers who usually require bulk enrollment feature, but the service is available for Samsung devices only. In consideration of customers with mixed device environment, Knox Manage implemented similar service by Google, called _Zero-touch_, from 19.09. It means we now support bulk enrollment services for general Android devices as well. Automatic app deletion upon profile removal on kiosks Previously, once-downloaded kiosk apps stayed on the device side even after the removal of kiosk profiles or unenrollment upon IT admin's command. Now IT admins can decide whether to remove kiosk application from the device automatically or not when released from Kiosk mode. Default value is Allow (remove). AER advanced feature updates Knox Manage passed the standard level of Android Enterprise Recommended validation. And now, we plan to implement advanced features as well starting from fully managed and work profile devices. 19.09 update includes several advanced items like below. When compliance issue happens, work profile apps will be hidden, Advanced password policy for AER advanced requirement, Key guard management for AER advanced requirement, Zero-touch device owner enrollment Time zone setting IT admins can force Select Time zone of user devices. If time zone policy is setup, then the Date/Time auto configuration option will be grayed out. Android Go support through Android Enterprise Samsung Android Go devices does not have Knox platform and miss Knox API sets, so do Knox policies. However it was not clear for IT admins to understand such technical limitation. Android GO devices should be handled as a non-Samsung Android devices although the manufacturer is Samsung, and it is recommended to be enrolled through Android Enterprise if were to use. Deprecated features with Android 10 Some EMM features are dependent to device OS. With huge updates in Android 10, the below features will not be supported from Android 10 devices. Please refer to the below deprecation list when managing Android 10 devices. MDM Profile > Knox > Container Data > Moving a file to Knox area / general area, Android Enterprise / Android (Legacy) > System > S Beam, Android Enterprise / Android (Legacy) > Interface > NFC Control, Knox > Firewall > Container > All Packages ( By Application is still available), Knox / Android (Legacy) > Security > Smart Card Browser Authentication, Android (Legacy) > Security / App / System > \u2026 > Device Lock, Device Command > Device > Lock & Unlock device / Power off device / Data reset, Device detailed information > Wi-Fi & Network data usage Updated features with Android 10 , Containers (Knox Workspace in Samsung Legacy, work profile in AE device) should be created manually through notification bar. High Accuracy setup also requires manual notification bar. Application runtime permission at Android Legacy can't be forced to end user. In other words, end user can change configuration from the device settings anytime later. Silent COMP deployment is limited from Android 10. If the device screen is off, then end user must click notification to deploy COMP later.

The Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) license was only used for the Knox Workspace (legacy) mode. Starting this release, you can use a KPE license in the Android Enterprise (AE) mode to take advantage of Premium features. Knox E-FOTA is not included in a KPE license. It is included in Knox Suite.

The devices must be Samsung devices. One UI Core devices (that is, non-Knox Samsung devices, formerly known as JDM devices) do not support Premium features with a KPE license. Applying KPE policies on such a device will cause unexpected errors that require a factory reset. #Allow USB devices for default access by app You can now set control policies for USB access for each application. Set this policy to Allow to add an app to the allowlist. When using that app, the user will not be prompted through a popup message to grant permission to allow USB usage. It will always be allowed. You'll need to provide the following to identify the app to be allowed: Package name of the target application , Vendor ID , USB product ID , Set this policy to Disallow, or do not apply this policy, if you want users to specify (though the popup message) whether they want to allow or deny USB access for the app. A KPE or Knox Suite license is required to configure this setting in the Work profile area. When adding or modifying an Android Enterprise profile, you can find this setting in Samsung Knox > Interface > Allow USB devices for default access by app. #Enforce firmware auto-update on Wi-Fi You can now enforce automatic firmware updates when the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network. Set this policy to Use to allow firmware auto-updates over a Wi-Fi network. Device users will not be able to turn this setting off. Set this policy to Do not use to allow the device user to choose whether or not to allow auto-updates over Wi-Fi. When adding or modifying an Android Enterprise profile, you can find this setting in Samsung Knox > System > Enforce Firmware Auto Update on Wi-Fi. #APN configuration with wildcard variable The Access Point Username and Access Point Password settings now allow the following wildcard variables: Device IMEI, Device serial number When adding or modifying an Android Enterprise profile, you can find these settings in Samsung Knox > APN. #Manage file uploads through the Kiosk Browser You can now allow or disallow file uploads through the Kiosk Browser.

When adding or modifying an Android Enterprise or Android Legacy profile, you can find this setting in the following paths: Android Enterprise > Kiosk > Kiosk app settings > File Upload. Android Legacy > Kiosk > Kiosk app settings > File Upload. #Secure Startup policy The Secure Startup policy has been added for devices running an OS earlier than Android P in Android Legacy mode. This policy allows you to allow or disallow users from setting the Secure Startup feature on devices. When Secure Startup is set and the user enters the wrong password 30 times, the device will undergo a factory reset even if you have restricted factory resets through a policy. To avoid this situation, set the Secure Startup policy to Disallow. When adding or modifying an Android Legacy profile, you can find this setting in Android Legacy > Security > Secure Startup. Kiosk #Mobile hotspot setting for Kiosk devices You can now allow users to configure the Mobile Hotspot setting in kiosk devices. When adding or modifying a kiosk using the Kiosk Wizard, you can select Hotspot in the Device Setting menu. For more information on configuring kiosk device settings, see Configure device settings.

Report #Report enhancement for Device Detail The following details were added to the Device Detail report: Wi-Fi AP name, AP MAC address, Hidden SSID, External SD card (Y/N) iOS #Apple VPP enhancement Previously, Knox Manage only supported user-based app assignment for the Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP). This requires adding VPP users before assigning VPP apps to their devices. Moreover, end users also had to log in with their Apple ID to install the VPP application. Starting this release, Knox Manage supports device-based VPP app assignment, which doesn't require Apple ID based mapping. You no longer need to go through the VPP user management process. You can just assign the app to groups or organizations. When assigning a VPP application, you can do the following: Check the license usage synced from Apple Business Manager ( https://business.apple.com ). Select the assignment type - Device or User. The Device assignment type is based on the device's serial number and works without Apple ID configuration on the device. If you choose this, you don't need to set up any Apple IDs. The User assignment type works as it did before 20.06. Select the install type - Manual or Automatic. If you select Manual, the assigned application becomes available in the Knox Manage agent's Application Store for the user to download. If you select Automatic, the app is installed on target devices without user intervention. Regardless of install type, the installation status can be seen on the Knox Manage agent's Application Store. Select a target type - Group or Organization.

            "content": "Knox Manage 20.08 release notes. Pre-notice - Legacy enrollment from Android 11 is no longer supported Android device management has been shifting from Android Legacy to Android Enterprise. While most EMM vendors stopped supporting Android Legacy for Android 10, Knox Manage continued to do so. However, Knox Manage cannot support new enrollments of Android 11 devices to the Android Legacy mode. Android 10 devices previously enrolled in Android Legacy mode are still supported even when they're upgraded to Android 11. Knox Manage continues to support Android Legacy for devices running an OS earlier than Android 11, however, the scope is limited to bug fixes. New features and product design are focused on the Android Enterprise implementation. Pre-notice - Work profile enhancements in Android 11 Android 11 introduces improved support for work profiles on company-owned devices. In Knox Manage, devices enrolled in the Fully Managed with Work Profile type are upgraded to the newly designed type in Android 11. For more information, visit the following web pages: https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/work-profile-privacy, https://developer.android.com/preview/work Some features in the fully managed device area may not be available when a device is upgraded to Android 11. If this concerns you, we recommend you use the fully managed type or the work profile type instead of the fully managed with work profile type. In 20.10 (October 2020), the Knox Manage console's terminology usage and feature guidance will reflect these changes. The Knox Manage team will also provide the following: A list of affected features. A migration guide. Console #KSP zero-day support Knox Service Plugin (KSP) now comes with zero-day support, which means the full functionality of KSP is provided without any delay. The latest KSP features are immediately available in Knox Manage as soon as the KSP app is updated, regardless of the Knox Manage release. . Before 20.08 , Starting 20.08 - , - , - Supported KSP features , A range of select KSP features. All features from the KSP application. New feature delivery , Upon Knox Manage release. Upon KSP version update (zero day). Location , KSP policies are mixed in various sections of the Samsung Knox menu, along with non-KSP policies. All KSP features are in the Knox Service Plugin category in the Samsung Knox menu. Values of KSP settings , Allow, Disallow, Enable, Disable , True, False Setting Debug Mode to True allows you to check which policies were applied through KSP agents. ##Limitations KSP features are directly pulled from the KSP app. That is, all KSP features are dependent on the KSP app. The following are limitations in the Knox Manage admin portal due to the KSP implementation. Note these limitations to ensure that your policies are properly applied. Knox Service Plugin is only available in English. Hence, the KSP policies in Knox Manage are only available in English, regardless of the language set in the Knox Manage admin portal. Mandatory fields are not highlighted. When configuring KSP features, the IT admin must know the critical input values they need to provide. Configuring duplicate policies can result in abnormal behavior. Some KSP policies have the same functionality as built-in Knox Manage policies. To prevent IT admins from setting duplicate policies, the Knox Manage admin portal shows a ![](../assets/info.png) , When you set multiple KSP profiles for an end user, only the profile with the highest priority is applied to their device. If you want to apply all KSP policies from those profiles, we recommend you do either of the following solutions: Apply all the KSP policies to the profile with the highest priority. Create a profile for KSP policies only and give that profile the highest priority. Existing KSP configurations are automatically migrated to the Knox Service Plugin category, and the values of these settings are changed as follows: Allow or Enable \u2192 True , Disallow or Disable \u2192 False This change cannot be adjusted by feature. The following two KSP policies need more attention: Before 20.08 Starting 20.08 System &gt; Device Customization Controls &gt; Predictive Text Possible values - Enable or Disable Disable Predictive Text Possible values - True or False System &gt; Device Customization Controls &gt; App Suggestion Possible values - Enable or Disable Disable App Suggestion Possible values - True or False Notice that in 20.08, the policies above are the opposite of the corresponding policies from before 20.08. Suppose you previously set Predictive Text to Enable. When the migration is complete, the new policy name is Disable Predictive Text and its value is now True. In this case, your policy has effectively been reversed during migration. Hence, we recommend that you review your settings for these two policies in 20.08. A profile you exported before 20.08 cannot be imported to 20.08 of the Knox Manage admin portal. Please export that profile again in 20.08. #Other console enhancements , Profile names - Profile names can now include spaces. iOS VPP app management enhancements: You can now assign up to 10 VPP apps at the same time, as long as the apps have the same settings like assignment type, install type, and targets. When you set an iOS VPP app to be installed automatically, you can set it to be updated automatically as well. When you unassign an iOS VPP app, the app will be removed automatically. Admin management - When an admin account is removed from the Knox Manage admin portal, that account's session will be terminated immediately. Users, groups, and organizations synced through AD/LDAP can now be deleted all at once. Device commands #USIM PIN lock or unlock through device commands SIM card locking is now supported through device commands. Previously, profiles were used to perform this operation. The following are the new device commands: Lock SIM PIN - Enable SIM lock with a new PIN. Unlock SIM PIN - Disable a SIM PIN or set a new PIN. If a SIM lock policy has been previously configured through a profile, that policy is still in effect. You can modify and unlock the SIM PIN through a device command. These policies are available in both Android Legacy and Android Enterprise (DO and COMP) Before 20.08 Starting 20.08 How to apply By assigning and applying a profile to a group or organization. By sending a device command to one or more devices or to a group. #New device commands ##Lock SIM PIN ##Unlock SIM PIN Applications #Managed configurations for MGP Private apps You can now set up managed configurations for managed Google Play (MGP) apps. Previously, Knox Manage only supported managed configurations for general MGP apps. #AE App Permission policy enhancement When configuring the App permission exception policy list under Profile > Android Enterprise > Application > App Permission, you can now do the following. Automatically apply the same action ( Prompt, Grant, or Deny ) to all configurable items through the Apply to all items below field. Set Apply to all items below to '-' to specify a different action for each configurable item. Profile #Windows 10 support enhancements for PC The following enhancements were made: ##Reboot Device command The Reboot Device command was added. When you send this device command, the end user has 5 minutes to finish any ongoing work on their device before the reboot starts. ##App Install/Run Blocklist option Previously, when adding apps to the application blocklist, only apps of type APPX were supported. Starting this release, you can add SnippingTool.exe to the list of apps that can be blocked. When adding or modifying a Windows profile, you can find this setting in Windows > Application > Add App Install Block/Allowlist (select Application blocklist settings ) > App Install/Run Blocklist. ##Removable Storage You can block write access to removable storage devices (such as a USB memory stick) by setting the Removable Storage policy to Disallow. If you set this policy to Allow, or if you do nothing with this policy, write access to the removable storage is allowed. When adding or modifying a Windows profile, you can find this setting in Windows > Interface > Removable Storage. The USB policy ( Interface > USB ) only applies to Windows mobile devices. ##VPN update for Windows devices , You can now allow (or disallow) end users to change their VPN settings. When adding or modifying a Windows profile, you can find this setting in Windows > System > VPN. When setting up the VPN configuration on devices, you can distribute end users across the following VPN clients: Pulse Secure , Check Point Capsule VPN , F5 Access , Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect , SonicWall Mobile Connect When adding or modifying a Windows profile, you can find this setting in Windows > VPN. #Device name configuration for iOS DEP You can now configure iOS DEP device names to include the user ID, according to the DEP style. This feature is available in Setting > iOS > DEP Server Setting > DEP Device Name. #Certificate installation area in Android Enterprise Previously, a certificate could only be installed in both the Fully Managed and the Work Profile areas. Now, you can install certificates according to your needs - in either Fully Managed or Work Profile or both. When adding or modifying an Android Enterprise profile, you can find this setting in Android Enterprise > Certificate > Install Area. Kiosk #Single App Kiosk mode The following enhancements were made: The Single App Kiosk mode's delivery method was enhanced to use an Android launcher similar to the one used for the Multiple App Kiosk mode. This enhancement allows you to create Single App Kiosks stably and easily. You can now set device settings for Single App Kiosks in the Kiosk Wizard. Single App Kiosks created before 20.08 will continue to work without updates as long as no changes are made on them. This new Single App Kiosk works only with the Knox Manage 20.08 agent. Hence, the Knox Manage agent must be updated to the latest version. Only one app can be assigned in a Single App Kiosk. #Exit Kiosk without unenrollment All Kiosk modes (Single App, Multiple App, and Kiosk Browser) can be temporarily turned off without unenrollment, regardless of whether they're in offline or online state. This feature is only applicable to Kiosks created in 20.08 or later. ##To exit Kiosk mode Provide an Exit Kiosk Code to the end user. You can get the code from Device Detail > Security > Kiosk Mode Status > Exit Kiosk Code. The code is randomly regenerated after it's applied to the device to prevent it from being used again without authorization from an IT admin. The user managing the Kiosk device must do the following: 1. Tap the icon. In the case of a Single App Kiosk, you'll need to tap the Home or Back button to make this icon appear. The icon disappears after 5 seconds of inactivity. 2. In the \"About Kiosk\" screen, tap Exit Kiosk. 3. Enter the Exit Kiosk Code from the IT admin. ##To re-enter Kiosk mode An IT admin must apply a profile update to the device. #Other Kiosk enhancements The Knox Manage agent must be updated to the latest version for these new features to take effect. Bookmark in Multiple App Kiosk mode now supports file uploads and downloads. You can now set Kiosk Browser and Secure Browser to be automatically updated through profile policies. When adding or modifying a profile, you can find these settings in the following locations: Secure Browser: Android Enterprise > Secure Browser > App Auto Update. Kiosk Browser: Android Enterprise or Android Legacy > Kiosk > Kiosk app settings (select Kiosk Browser ) > App Auto Update. The loading status is now shown on the progress bar: Content #Increased maximum file size limit Previously, the maximum content size was 300 MB. In 20.08, this limit was increased to 1.0 GB. Knox E-FOTA license usage with Knox Suite In addition to the Knox E-FOTA admin portal, you can now view the Knox E-FOTA license usage in the following locations as well: License widget in the Knox Manage admin portal's Dashboard. SamsungKnox.com Dashboard. Remote Support session timeout In this release, a session timeout was introduced in the Remote Support tool to prohibit security issues at the customers' end. When controlling devices through the Remote Support Viewer, 15 minutes of inactivity (regardless of the end user's device-side action) will trigger a popup asking if you want to extend the session.

            "content": "Knox Manage 20.11 release notes. Android Legacy mode deprecation for Android 11 Android device management now uses Android Enterprise instead of Android Legacy. Going forward, Knox Manage does not support new enrollments of Android 11 devices to the Android Legacy mode. Android 10 devices previously enrolled in Android Legacy mode are still supported even when they're upgraded to Android 11. For devices running an OS earlier than Android 11, Knox Manage continues to support Android Legacy. However, the scope of this support is limited to bug fixes. New features and product design are focused on the Android Enterprise implementation. #Device Admin deprecation Due to evolving needs of Enterprise users, the Device Admin API is currently used for a wider array of use cases than it was originally designed for. Since Device Admin isn't well suited to support today's enterprise requirements, Android is deprecating Device Admin. As a part of this transition, starting with the Android 10 release, the following policies are no longer supported in Android Legacy mode. To ensure continued data and device security, change these policies to use managed device and work profile modes to manage your devices. Android Legacy > System > Camera, Android Legacy > Security > Device Password (including KeyGuard), Android Legacy > Interface > Wi-Fi Following the KM 20.11 release, the Wi-Fi policy is set to Allow by default, regardless of the value set. Samsung Knox devices will continue to support Camera and Password policies, but these policies are no longer supported on non-Samsung devices. Work profile enhancements in Android 11 Android 11 introduces improved support for work profiles on company-owned devices. With the Android 11 release, the following enhancements are available: New Work profile type - The Work Profile on Company-owned device (WP-C) profile type is now available. There are several commands available for each device using this profile type. For the KM v 20.11 release, Work Profile on company-owned mode does not support the use of Samsung Knox policy, except for Knox Service Plugin (KSP) features. If you apply Samsung Knox policies to your devices, we recommend that you postpone updating to Android 11 OS until KM release 20.12 or later. Deprecated Fully Managed with Work Profile device profile type - The Fully Managed with Work Profile device profile is no longer available. For devices previously enrolled in this profile, you can automatically convert these devices to Work Profile on Company-owned devices when you upgrade their firmware to Android 11. However, we recommend using Knox Manage's device command Switch to Fully Manage (Remove Work Profile) before you upgrade the device's firmware. After you change to the new device profile, you can modify the profile settings from the Organization / User menu. Follow these instructions to set up a Work Profile on a Company-owned Device (WP-C) device profile. 1. Enroll your company-owned devices using either the QR code or Zero-touch method. 2. Go to Android Enterprise > System, and enable the appropriate switches for each profile menu. #QR code method Use the following process to enroll your devices using the QR code method. 1. Unbox your device and press the Power button to start it up. When the Welcome message shows, tap Next five times. The Scanning for a QR code screen opens. 2. Use your phone's camera to scan the QR code included in the email you received from your network admin. 3. Follow onscreen instructions to finish setting up your device. #Zero-touch method Use the following process to enroll your devices using the Zero-touch method. 1. Connect to to begin setting up your device. 2. Go to Configurations > Work Profile on Corporate-owned Device > Mode > Property, enter one of the following to configure Zero-touch: For corporate-owned devices, personally enabled devices (COPE), enter PO. For fully managed devices, enter DO. After the devices are factory reset, they are automatically enrolled to WP-C mode. KSP availability From the KM 20.11 release, KSP features are available on Fully managed with Work Profile devices. To use KSP features on devices previously enrolled with Fully Managed with Work Profile, the IT admin must modify the Organization/User setting, and re-enroll these devices to the Fully Managed with Work Profile device profile. Certificate alias enhancements The certificate alias includes improvements to automatically follow the name of the certificate. Certificate Type EMM Management Certificate Connector interworking Issuing external CA Alias Setting Advanced &gt; Certificate &gt; External Certificate &gt; External Certificate Name Advanced &gt; Directory Service &gt; Service Name Advanced &gt; Certificate &gt; Certificate Template &gt; Template Name Certificate Setting Device enrollment enhancements Starting with KM 20.11, the following device enrollment enhancements are available. 1. Limited enrollment - IT admins can now limit device enrollment based on OS version or model names. Depending upon the settings specified, only the devices that meet the required conditions are enrolled. Currently, Limited Enrollment is only available for Android devices. 2. Windows device enrollment - Enrolling Windows 10 devices is now easier using the Deep Link Windows specifications, instead of the PPKG type of installation. To enroll a new Windows device, users only need to sign in with their EMM account details and all the settings and associated information is automatically made available on the device. On the other end of this enrollment process, all necessary authentication processes are already completed by the KM client, so the IT admin does not need to enter any information manually. This enhanced way of enrollment, makes the process easier and seamless. Geofencing-related security enhancements Currently, this feature is not available in the US. From 20.11, IT admins can setup a security policy to automatically lock a device if it moves out of a predetermined and preset geolocation boundary. This profile is, in a nutshell, the ability to set up a virtual fence for the device. After the IT admin sets up the geofencing boundary, if the device moves out of this boundary, it is locked. The lock process is automatic and needs intervention from the IT admin or the user to unlock the device. In case of a device with multiple profiles, the device is locked when it moves out of all fenced areas. Currently, this feature is available only on Samsung devices with Android Enterprise running Android P OS or less for legacy enrollments. Once a device is locked, it does not unlock until either the user unlocks it using a code or the IT admin unlocks it using an unlock device command. Content management improvements For devices running Android 10 and higher, Knox Manage now includes the following restrictions. Download path limitations - For devices running Android 10 and higher, users can only download contents in the preset Download folder on the device. File overwrite restrictions - For devices running Android 10, users cannot update existing files with new content even if the file names match. File open restrictions - For devices running Android 10, users cannot open files downloaded from the Knox Manage Agent. Secure Browser enhancements The inbuilt Knox Manage Secure Browser also includes the following enhancements. Add shortcut to home screen - Users can now add Secure Browser bookmarks as shortcuts to the device's home screen. Doing so helps users quickly navigate to previously visited URLs. Bookmark information - Secure user bookmarks now provide an additional information screen that includes details such as app version and open source license details. Ability to show pop-up dialogs - Starting with this release, Secure Browser can now show pop-up dialog boxes or windows for websites that use them; for example to show third party authentication or file upload windows. Other enhancements KM 20.11 also includes the following additional enhancements for increased security and better user experience. Show linked account details - The account information screen now shows information about the Samsung Account linked to the KM account on the device. License key type - The License screen now includes information about they type of KM License Key for the device, for example trial or commercial license. Modify contact and phone component details - The Modify Kiosk screen now includes two separate components for contacts and phone. Sync improvements - The VPP sync process is now modified to exclude Mac apps from the sync process. Deleted device information - The information related to deleted devices, such as unenrollment code, unlock code, and deletion date, are now shown in a separate view. To see details of a delete device, go to Device screen, and then click Deleted Devices to open the Deleted Devices screen.

            "content": "Knox Manage 21.01 release notes. This Knox Manage 21.01 release scheduled to go live in January 2021, includes several improvements and enhancements to existing features and functionality. KME console integration Starting KM 21.01, the Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME) API is now integrated with the KM console. The following UI changes are now part of KM: Samsung Account Single-sign on - KME Users need to log in with their Samsung account SSO credentials to use KME features from within the KM console. KME features - The two key features of KME, namely Device and Profile management are now available in the KM admin console. Device Enrollment menu - Existing KME and DEP menu items are now consolidated to form the Device Enrollment menu item. KME profiles - KM users can now view, create, and delete KME profiles from the KM console. The KME profile creation process and UI in KM is simpler and more user-friendly. Android Enterprise enhancements Android device management now uses Android Enterprise instead of Android Legacy. Going forward, Knox Manage only supports new enrollments of Android 11 devices to the Android Enterprise mode. Android 10 devices previously enrolled in Android Legacy mode are still supported even when they're upgraded to Android 11. For devices running an OS earlier than Android 11, Knox Manage continues to support Android Legacy, with the scope limited to bug fixes. #Android 11 provisioning improvements For devices running Android 11, KM now supports a new device provisioning method that lets the device user choose the device's mode, depending upon whether the device is for Work use only or work and personal use. KM still supports all the older provisioning methods that were available until the Android 10 release. When the device was enrolled using KME or Zero-touch, the device user can choose the enrollment type. #Knox Support on Work Profile on company-owned device Until KM 20.11, KM only supported Android Enterprise policies for device management. Going forward, for devices running a Work Profile on a company-owned device, KM now supports Knox policies. #Managed Google Play Web application Starting this release, KM now supports web version of the Managed Google Play (MGP) app, using the Google Chrome browser. Note that before you allow the use of MGP's web version, you must approve the use of Google's Chrome browser. If Chrome isn't on the list of allowed applications, you cannot add MGP web app. To add a new MGP web app, do as follows: 1. Go to the Application page > click Add > click Select Application type > click Public App (Managed Google Play Private, Web). The Managed Google Play Web Apps page opens. 2. On this page, enter the following information: Title - Ideally, this title must match the app's title on the MGP store. URL - This value is the web app's Google Play Store URL. Display - Depending upon the app, you may choose to deploy it to run in either full screen, standalone, or minimal UI display. 3. Return to the Application page > select the newly added app > click Assign. 4. On the Assign Application page, provide all the relevant information and assign device targets to this application. When you assign a MGP web app, you must also assign the Google Chrome app at the same time. #Managed configuration user interface and usability improvements The UI for Managed Configuration is now changed to use a custom method from Google's iframe method for better flexibility and improved usability, for example using diverse Wildcards. If you have already set up a managed configuration, you can choose to either use the previous configuration or use a new method. If there is no existing configuration, the new method is used for each new configuration. #System update freeze period When applying system updates to devices running Android 9 and higher, IT admins can now use the Freeze Period option to delay deployment of system update to target devices. The following are important points to consider: Support for all update policies - The Freeze Period option supports all kinds of update policy such as automatic, postpone, and windowed. Freeze periods apply one at a time - Currently, IT admins cannot set up freeze periods that overlap each other. IT admins can set up multiple freeze periods but only one freeze period applies to devices at one time. Freeze period duration - IT admins can add a total freeze period of 90 days. Multiple freeze periods - Two freeze periods cannot overlap each other and must remain separated by a minimum of 60 days. #Restrict applications from unknown sources For devices running Android 10 and higher, IT admins can now restrict the device user from installing applications from unknown sources. They can apply this restriction either on the entire device or just within the Work Profile. For devices running Android 9.0 or lower, this restriction applies to only the Work profile even if it is applied to the selected Device Wide option. #Advanced passcode security improvements Going forward, IT admins can specify the use of strong authentication for the password policies on the device. Once the IT admin sets up the strong password policy, the policy is immediately deployed to target devices. The following are important points to consider: In addition to the regular authentication methods - such as passcode, PIN, or biometric recognition - IT admins can set up a strong password policy on the device. Strong authentication is restricted to PIN and Password. IT admins can require device users to log in again on a set time interval of up to 72 hours. For example, the device user can unlock their device using fingerprint recognition on a regular basis, but they must log in using strong authentication such as a PIN or a password every 72 hours. #Message Customization For devices running Android 7 and higher, KM now supports message customization. Device users see error and support messages when they perform an action on their device that is blocked by the KM security policy. IT admins can now customize both short error codes as well as long support messages. For devices running Android 9 and higher, IT admins can also show customized support messages when the Work profile is wiped by either the IT admin or by the device user. Web-based Remote Support (beta release) KM 21.01 includes a beta release of a web version of Remote Support. During the beta period, the existing standalone version of the Remote Support app is also available. The web version of Remote Support provides the same features as the standalone version, such as unattended mode and screen sharing. For this beta release, recording and file browser features are unavailable. Only the screen capture feature is currently available in the web-based remote support app. Currently, this feature is supported on Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Safari browsers. Alert mail notification enhancement KM now includes the ability to send emails to the IT admin when managed devices are unenrolled or disconnected from KM. This feature enables IT admins to manage their devices without needing to actively monitor them. To set up notification emails, go to History > Alert > Email Alert Setting. iOS feature enhancements This release of KM includes the following iOS improvements to iOS support: DEP enrollment by User - IT admins can now select from the following options: User Assignment Method - IT admins can use this option to assign device users to DEP device before KM enrollment. User Authentication Method (New) - For this option, device users directly enter their user ID and password upon enrollment. New Policy Support - App Clips - App clips are instant ways for device users to quickly access and experience apps without installing them on their devices. From KM 21.01, IT admins can choose whether to allow this policy on their managed devices. App Block or Allowlist Policy - For devices running iOS 9.3+ and in Supervise mode, IT admins can now apply application block and allowlist policies to applications that were installed before enrolling the device in KM. Device commands - For devices running iOS 9.3+, iOS device commands are a new feature and currently only work in Supervised mode for Power Off and Reboot functions. Windows 10 app control by AppLocker AppLocker is an in-built Windows 10 app that you can use to control a variety of executable file formats, such as exe, Windows Installers, Scripts, Packaged apps, and DLL. For more information, see The Microsoft AppLocker Guide. Before device users can use AppLocker on their managed device, they need to do as follows: 1. Create XML rules using AppLocker wizard: 1. On your Windows 10 device, start Group Policy Editor. 2. Go to `Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Application Control Policies\\AppLocker`, right-click and select Properties, then enable Rules which you need to control in your enterprise and select Enforce rules. Doing so turns on AppLocker rules. 3. Click OK. 4. On the screen that opens, right-click and click Create Default Rules, and then follow onscreen instructions on the AppLocker wizard to configure your rules. For example, the following image shows how to create an XML rule to restrict the use of a screen capture tool. 2. Export the newly created XML rules to your local drive. 3. Go to the KM console > copy and paste the XML rules to your Knox Manage Profile, under the AppLocker menu. 4. Deploy the newly created profile to your managed Windows 10 devices. Kiosk feature enhancements This release includes the following enhancements for the Kiosk feature: Locktask allowlist feature for single/multi Kiosk - IT admins can now configure app packages for locktask allowlists in single as well as multi-kiosk devices. You can set a list of apps that can be run even if they are not included in the single/multi-app kiosk. Secure Browser Component - The multi-kiosk wizard includes a new component, namely Secure Browser. This component is only available for accounts with a Knox Suite license. To use the Secure Browser component, you must set up the Secure Browser policy as follows - Profile > Secure Browser > set the option to Use. Access to Airplane mode and Google Account settings - IT admins can now access airplane mode and Google account settings on kiosk devices. KM agent update method improvements This release rolls out support for a new Knox Manage update method with the following options: Manual, User Consent (Notification and Update), Force Update (once a day) IT admins can choose to use this new method of KM update instead of the existing version. Note that the old version of KM update is scheduled to be deprecated. License registration usability enhancements If the reseller ordered Knox Manage by entering 'Knox Customer ID' at SLM, IT admin can get the licenses through KM from the Get license Key menu. IT admins can now easily register the license that was provided to them by their Knox reseller. IT admins can choose to register their licenses manually or through automatic registration. Items to note: Keys are available only for Knox Manage and Knox Suite. Only keys with with a valid end date are listed. Keys with a valid license status are available. New trial keys are also available. Other enhancements This KM release also includes the following additional enhancements: When uploading or importing Apple APNs certificate, IT admins can now enter their Apple ID which is then shown in the APNs Setting. If the default country code is set to South Korea, IT admins now need to provide a reason for downloading data. Applicable menu items are - Audit Log, Device Log, Device Detail > Audit Log, Device Detail > Device Log, and Device Detail > Device Diagnosis. The Device by Group report queries now include additional field options, such as Platform, Model Name, and Network Service Provider Name. The header menu now includes the console error codes.

            "content": "Knox Manage 21.02 release notes. This Knox Manage 21.02 release scheduled to go live on February 25, 2021 includes several improvements and enhancements to existing features and functionality. Android Enterprise enhancements This version of Knox Manage adds or improves the following features: Unified password policy, Work profile on company owned device, Wi-Fi setting > MSCHAPV2 authentication type #New updates and improvements in Unified Password Policy With this KM 21.02 release, Password and KeyGuard policies are now separated from the Security category and are moved to a new Password category. This change improves the usability of the KM console and helps IT admins set password-related policies - for both Fully Managed and Work Profile devices - easily. Using this new section on the KM console, IT admins can now: Configure the result of failed login attempts - Depending upon the type of profile on the device, the following things can happen: For WP-C devices IT admins can specify the number of failed log in attempts after which the devices are factory reset. Devices are unenrolled from KM upon factory reset. For WP-P devices IT admins can specify the number of failed work profile log in attempts after which the work profile is removed from the device. Devices are not unenrolled from KM even if the work profile is removed from the device. Configure password compliance policies - IT admins can now specify what happens when device passwords do not comply with IT security standards. Some examples of non-compliance are either the password does not meet the minimum length or if the password has expired. The following options are available to IT admins upon non-compliance: Hide Work apps , Hide Work apps and suspend Personal apps , Take no action #Work profile on company-owned device improvements This release offers the following improvements to Android Enterprise work profiles: Encourage device users to use work profile - In some cases, device users may turn off work profiles on their WP-C devices. IT admins can now specify that after a set amount of time, if the device user has not restarted the Work profile, all Personal apps - outside of emergency calls and a few other important apps - are suspended. IT admins can specify a maximum number of days (between 3 to 30 days) or hours (between 72 and 720 hours) after which the device users see a notification on their device alerting them as to the reason for suspension of Personal apps. Restrict the use of personal Google Play accounts and apps - Currently, users can set up personal Google Play accounts and install apps on the Personal area of their WP-C enrolled devices. Starting with this release, IT admins can now configure allowlist and blocklist policies to restrict the use of personal Google Play accounts and installation of personal apps on devices. IT admins can choose to block all or selected apps; or allow selected apps only on target devices. These policies apply to apps downloaded from managed Google Play only, apps that are already installed or are directly installed using APKs are not impacted. For already installed apps, use the previously set up app blocklist and allowlist policy. Usability improvements - Starting with this release, IT admins can turn on the Highlight Work Profile on Company-owned Devices Profile Only setting to show the available policies highlighted in blue. #Additional authentication support for Wi-Fi setting Starting this release, KM now supports a new MSCHAPV2 authentication type for Wi-Fi settings. Azure Domain Service-based Azure AD synchronization support Starting KM 21.02, IT admins can now connect to cloud-based Azure AD and synchronize the following information directly to the KM admin console: Directory type - Azure AD, Use, Group, Organization If Azure Domain Service is selected as the directory type, the account does not connect to the server through the cloud connector. If you experience connection errors, you may need to turn off the firewall on the target device. KME integration improvements This release adds the following functionality to the KM and KME integration: KME profiles - Until KM 21.01, IT admins could create KME profiles from within the KM admin console. Starting KM 21.02, IT admins can modify KME profiles from the KM admin console. AE enrollment for devices running Android OS 11 - KM now supports enrollment of Android devices running OS Android 11. The IT admin can choose between fully managed and WP-C enrollment types during the provisioning process. The enrollment settings for devices running Android OS 10 or lower remain unchanged. Limited Enrollment improvements KM 21.02 adds the following two improvements to the Limited Enrollment settings: Additional limited enrollment condition - The default condition available for limited enrollment is OR. This release adds a new AND condition. Using this new condition, IT admins can choose to limit enrollment to devices matching more than one criteria, such as Android 11, Model Name, and IMEI. KME integration - IT admins are now able to choose between enrolling all devices or only for devices managed using KME in Limited Enrollment. For KME devices, IT admins cannot enroll devices using manual registration or Zero Touch. Improved kiosk permission process Currently, Kiosk mode is not supported on Android Go edition devices. IT admins now have an improved Kiosk permissions process at their disposal. Upon installation of Kiosk launchers - both single and multi-Kiosk modes - KM automatically grants call and SMS permissions to devices. Device users can then optionally choose to grant or deny additional permissions, such as notification permissions for multi-Kiosk devices, or Window overlay permission for single kiosk devices. Until this release, the only way to close the permission settings notifications on the device was for the device user to accept all permissions. Now, IT admins can choose to show the permission notification only when the Kiosk Launcher app is running. The device user can now choose to close the notification without granting any permissions to the app. iOS improvement This release adds the following iOS improvements: Force OS Update - IT admins can now force iOS devices enrolled under the supervised mode to the latest OS version. IT admins can choose between the following update methods: Download or install Download and install doesn't happen continuously. If the update file is already downloaded on the device, then only the install command is carried out. If the update file is not downloaded to the device, deploying this command downloads the file. To install the OS update, deploy the Download or install or Install only option. Download only , Install only IT admins can access this option on the KM admin console under iOS Device Command > Device > OS Update (Supervised). Support for lost or stolen devices - In case of iOS devices that are lost, stolen, or otherwise misplaced, IT admins can now remotely enable Lost Mode on these devices. When Lost Mode is enabled on a device, the device is locked with a message, contact phone number, and instructions on what to do when such a device is found. IT admins can now check the location of such devices, even when location permissions are turned off. Devices with Lost Mode enabled cannot be unenrolled from KM. IT Admins must disable Lost Mode to allow the device user to use the device again. IT admins can access this option on the KM admin console under iOS Device Command > Device > Enable/Disable Lost Mode (Supervised). Device Location History Improvements - Going forward, location history for iOS devices is stored for 30 days from the last collection date. The check location device command is activated in the case where device location is collected. Note that the device user must run the KM agent and agree to allow collection of the device's location. Open API documentation improvements Samsung Knox's Developer Documentation site now includes KM Open API references. Geofencing event notifications Consider the following items:, Geofencing is not available in USA. For Note 8 devices running the N OS, the Geofencing area radius size set in the admin console unit is recognized in miles not meters.

This release improves the usability of the floating icons for single Kiosk devices, so that the users can use these icons on the Kiosk launcher. Close UX on open source license screen - The Open Source license screen now includes a button to close the screen and return to the previous screen. iOS enhancements This release adds the following iOS enhancements. #Locate devices in background Currently, KM can collect a device's location data only after the device user opens the KM Agent and allows the collection of device data from the Collect Device Location page. From this release, the device user only needs to provide this permission once, after which the process runs in the background. Before you can collect location data for iOS devices, you must allow the collection of location data from the KM console > left navigation menu > Setting > Configuration > Knox Manage Agent Policy > Allow Collecting Location Data > set to Use. When the device user is prompted on the device to allow collection of location data by the KM agent, the device user must select Always Allow. The device's location data is now collected whenever the device moves 500 m or more. IT admins can view this information from the KM console > left navigation menu > Device > iOS Device Command page > click Check Location > Check Location page opens. #VPP token deletion In case of VPP admin account changes or the VPP token being reset, IT admins can now delete existing VPP tokens, resulting in revoking licenses and deleting VPP apps from devices and the KM console. If the IT admin renews the VPP token, then the assigned licenses as well as the apps on the target devices remain intact while the token is renewed. You can access the VPP Server Settings page, on the KM console > left hand menu > Setting > iOS > VPP Server setting. The buttons in the previous image are available after the VPP token is registered. #Consolidate VPP user into KM User Management Starting with this release, the VPP user management menu is merged with the KM users menu, so that all users are managed from a single screen. VPP functions such as sending out VPP invitations and deleting users from VPP continue to be supported from the user menu. #Bulk assignment of DEP users KM now supports bulk assignment of DEP users to improve the usability and convenience of individual user assignment when activating a large number of iOS devices. If you create and upload a bulk assignment template, including a user ID and device serial number in advance, the devices synced from Apple Business Manager are automatically assigned to the user ID. Once the devices are assigned to the user ID, KM activation is complete. You can access bulk assignment on the KM console > left hand menu > Device enrollment > Apple DEP > DEP Device Management > Bulk Assign Users. #Support Exchange OAuth 2.0 Exchange settings now support the OAuth 2.0 authentication type for devices running iOS 12 or higher. You can access this option on the KM console > left hand menu > Policy > Add or Modify iOS policy > Exchange > Use OAuth section. Mobile content management enhancements #Reuse content files multiple times IT admins can now reuse a single content file, as long as they change the Content Name, that is, the file's name on the console. If a file with the same content name is added to the console and assigned to the devices, the new content file overwrites the old file. To avoid accidentally overwriting existing files, change the Content Name for duplicate files. To add new content files for target devices, on the KM console > left hand menu > Content > Add. #Delete contents during unenrollment and unassignment of devices Target devices often contain sensitive or confidential data that is compromised if the device is unenrolled or unassigned from KM. In such cases, IT admins can set up rules to automatically delete content from devices when they are unassigned or unenrolled from KM. When devices are unassigned or unenrolled, the content deleted from such devices remains in the KM console and can be reassigned to other groups. You can access these options on the KM console > left hand menu > Setting > Basic configuration > Device Tab. #Support 2 GB contents IT admins can now add contents up to 2 GB in size to individual devices. This increased capacity means IT admins can send crucial information and data to devices when necessary. Mobile app management enhancements #App installation status improvements Starting with this release, IT admins can check when an app's status is not installed. For example, if an optional app is not installed on the target device, the IT admin see a notification that can allow them to determine why this app was not installed on the target device and can take corrective action, such as asking the device users to install the app. To set up and configure the tooltip to show on the device, on the KM console > left hand menu > Application > Application Detail > Device Tab > Install Status Field. #Add a duplicate package as Internal and MGP Private App For apps with the same package name, KM now allows IT admins to register these apps as duplicate entries for each internal and MGP app type. What this change means is that in the Application menu, Internal and MGP apps can now have the same app package name at the same time. #Application details improvements The Application Details page now includes two new columns providing information about the last seen time and the serial number of a specific application on target devices. You can find these two columns and more information about the application on the target device on KM console > left hand menu > Application > Application Detail > Device Tab. Other enhancements This release also includes the following enhancements: Agent error message improvements - Error messages shown on the device include improvements that provide more details about the issue that caused the error as well as a method to troubleshoot the error. Each error message now includes an error code, title, and descriptive message. Limited permissions of the organization's subadmin - IT admins can now give additional permissions - full permissions; the new default access level - to subadmins within their organization, allowing them to add, modify, and delete organization level data. IT admins can provide this information on the KM console > left hand menu > Setting > Administrator. Support privacy policies based on country and language - Starting with KM 21.04, seven additional Privacy Policies including GDPR, LGPD, KVKK, and CCPA are supported and shown on the target device in the language based on the device's locale and country code as specified in the KM Admin console. The device user can see it when they enroll the device and after the device is enrolled, the device user can also view this information from the KM Agent > About. New additional API - KM now supports the new Read Audit Log API. Delete multiple AD/LDAP sync exceptions - Starting with this release, you can now delete all sync exceptions in AD/LDAP at the same time. Dashboard auto refresh intervals - You can now set the Dashboard auto refresh interval for values between 1 minute and the maximum console session timeout interval. Last seen hour option - Dashboard management now includes a new option, under Advanced > Dashboard Management > Add Dashboard (Widget) > Select Widget (Last Seen).

            "content": "Knox Manage 21.06 release notes. This Knox Manage 21.06 release scheduled to go live on June 16, 2021 includes several improvements and enhancements to existing features and functionality. Highlights The following features constitute the highlights of this release: Support for shared devices with multiple users, Add Secondary Admin by E-mail Invitation, Azure AD based login to KM console, Application Deployment Scheduling, Support additional MDM policies for iOS devices Android Enterprise enhancements #Shared device for multiple users Starting with the KM 21.6 release, IT admins can set up devices so that multiple users can share the same device. This feature is particularly useful for devices that are used by visitors, guest users, or shift workers. This feature is available for all Samsung tablet devices and non-Samsung mobile devices running Android 9 OS or higher. To set up a shared device, do as follows: 1. On the KM console's left hand navigation menu, User > on the User page that opens > click Add. Follow on-screen instructions to create a new staging user. The IT admin provides the login credentials created at this stage to the device users. Depending upon your needs, select one of the following two options: Temporary - Choose this option for guest or visitor users. All the data including installed applications are deleted from the device when the user checks out of the device. Persistent - Choose this option for shift workers. All data and installed applications are retained even when the user checks out of the device. 2. Once you create a staging user, return to the User page > click the checkbox next to the device to select it and click Request Enrollment. KM sends an email to the staging user's email address with a link to the installation guide. The staging user follows instructions to enroll the device. 3. When the device is handed to a Temporary or Persistent user, the user checks in to the device with their login credentials. After they finish using the device, they can check out of it. Depending upon the user type selected when creating the staging user, the data on the device is either deleted or retained. 4. The IT admins can send further instructions to control the network and other UI options available to the shared device using the Device Settings page. To go to this page, on the Knox Manage console, go to Settings > Configuration > Staging and Shared Device. The shared device also has an option to Exit Shared Device Mode that the device user can use to exit out of the shared mode in case of emergencies or issues with the shared device mode. To exit the shared device mode, the device user uses a passcode that is given by the IT admin. Once all the issues are resolved, the IT admin can apply the shared device mode again using the Device Command functionality. Only Work Profile controls in Android Enterprise profile applies to shared device. #Password related enhancements , Work Profile password compliance improvements - Until KM 21.04, when the device user creates a password for the Work Profile that does not comply with the minimum password requirements set by the IT admin, all apps in the Work Profile are hidden. Staring with this release, all apps - except essential apps like Knox Manage - are suspended. Suspending the apps, as opposed to just hiding them, offers greater security since unauthorized users cannot gain access to any Work Profile data. Increase in Wi-Fi password character limits - Until KM 21.04, you could enter up to 63 characters as the Wi-Fi password. Starting with this release, you can enter up to 100 characters. #Resolving Managed Google Play account issues Devices with Managed Google Play (MGP) account issues are now shown with a security alert icon. IT admins can monitor the devices with issues and sync a new, and issue-free Managed Google Play account to the device using the Device Command page. Knox Service integration #Add a secondary admin using an email invitation Starting with this release, if the IT admin is logged in to KM using their Samsung SSO credentials, they can invite other secondary KM admins - such as super admins, sub-admins, service admins, or read-only users - using an email invite. This functionality is similar to the KCS process to invite users. The process to invite a secondary KM admin works as follows: 1. On the KM console left hand navigation menu, go to Settings > Administrator > Add. If you are logged in using your Samsung SSO credentials, you see the Administrator page as described in the next step. 2. On the Administrator page, enter all relevant information, and click Invite. When prompted, click OK. 3. If the email address entered on this page is correct, the target device user receives an email notification. When the email recipient clicks this link, the Verify your Samsung Account details page opens where they can verify their Samsung Account details. 4. The user then enters the appropriate details to create their new Samsung Account. 5. Upon successful completion of the account creation process, the Knox Admin Portal opens to show all relevant KCS services in a single unified portal. #Azure AD based SSO login Starting with this release, IT admins can access the KM console if they are logged in using an Active Directory account. The KM direct login page now includes a Sign in with AD option. Application deployment scheduling Starting with this release, the IT admin can schedule the deployment and installation of MGP or Internal applications on the device at a specific time. If necessary, the IT admin can also deploy or install the apps manually using a device command. The following restrictions apply to this improvement: This feature is supported only for MGP or internal Android apps. IT admins can set the scheduled deployment time for a specific date, and in 30 minute increments any time after 30 minutes from the time when they are creating the automatic deployment schedule, that is, the current time on the KM console. iOS #App Lock usability improvements The App Lock feature was improved to allow IT admins to select an app without entering the app's bundle ID. If the Application Block or Allowlist Settings are set and an app lock setting is applied to one or more apps, the App Lock app is automatically added to the Allowlist. #Add support for additional MDM policies This release adds support for the following additional MDM policies in the Security, Application, Phone, Interface (new policy category), and the System category under Profile. GDPR cookie policy For KM consoles with the EU locale settings, due to tightened regulatory compliance with GDPR, IT admins are now prompted to agree to collection of cookies from the KM console. If the IT admins do not allow the collection of cookies, features such as saving sign-in information and Do not show again functionality for notification dialog boxes does not work properly. The notice of cookie collection is shown to the IT admins when they log in to the KM console for the first time after the KM 21.6 release. IT admins can either click Accept and Close to allow all cookies, click Personalize to go to a screen that allows them to manage individual items, or click Continue without Accepting to dismiss the dialog and continue with the task at hand. IT admins can also change this selection on the login page using the Manage Cookies link. Other improvements and enhancements This release also includes the following improvements and enhancements to other features. Limited Enrollment UI improvements - The Limited Enrollment page now features option buttons for Device type, that is Devices and KME Devices. This option is available on the KM console under Settings > Android > Limited Enrollment.

This Knox Manage 21.09 release scheduled to go live on September 1st, 2021 includes several improvements and enhancements to existing features and functionality. Highlights The following features constitute the highlights of this release: Integration with Knox MSP Program, Enhancements to MDM device security, Use Azure AD SSO in KM direct login, Bulk enrollment for Windows 10 devices, MGP application enhancements, Shared device enhancements Knox Service integration #Knox MSP Program integration Starting with this release, Knox Manage (KM) is now included as one of the services available from within the Knox MSP Program. This integration with the Knox cloud service allows a unified customer management experience, so that KM now works within the same framework as other Knox services such as Knox Portal and Knox License. KM users have a Samsung Account like all other Knox cloud service components, but does not have its own Samsung admin portal. This change means that user application approval happens within the Knox portal. The following KM functionality is available from within the Knox MSP Program: Add KM Customer - The Knox MSP Program can add a new Knox Manage customer from within the Knox MSP Portal. When adding a new customer, the Knox MSP Program can provide all necessary and mandatory KM information such as customer ID, organizational information, and any other information needed to onboard the customer. By default, when adding a new customer, the customer's access permissions are set to No access, meaning the customer cannot access the Knox cloud service portal and is fully managed by the Knox MSP Program. The Knox MSP Program can change this permission to Full access, meaning the customer can access the Knox cloud service portal and is jointly managed by the Knox MSP Program. KM SSO login from the Knox MSP Portal - Users of the Knox MSP Portal can now access the KM console with their single sign-on login credentials. To access the KM console, go to left hand navigation menu > Customers > List of customers > click Active to open the KM console in a new browser tab. Change customer access permissions - Knox MSP Program users can also change the access permissions for KM customers from within the Knox MSP Portal. Note that the Knox MSP Program cannot change the access permission for a Full access customer into a No access customer. Once the access permissions are changed, the customer receives an email notification with details about the change as well as complete Knox portal registration information that they can use to log in to the Knox MSP Portal. KM service delink - Fully managed customers who have access to the Knox MSP Portal and jointly manage their account can also request to revoke the access rights of the Knox MSP Program to their account. This request is known as a KM service delink request. Once the request is accepted, the Knox MSP Program does not have access to the customer's account. Migrate existing KM tenants - Knox MSP Portal admins can also migrate existing KM customers to the Knox MSP Portal. KM notifications on Knox MSP Portal - Any notifications set up for customer accounts on KM are also shown on the Knox MSP Portal, including but not limited to: expired licenses, add new administrators, or add a new KM customer tenant. To view these notifications, on the Knox MSP Portal's left navigation menu, go to the Dashboard. View KM and Knox Services license usage - Knox MSP Program admins can also view details of the Knox Manage and Knox services' license usage, such as: Purchased seats , Remaining seats , Used seats of KM or KS , License key information #Azure AD SSO in KM Direct Login Going forward, KM users can now use their Knox cloud service's Azure AD single sign-on login to log in to Knox Manage. For more information about how to log in to the Knox cloud service portal, including KM, using Azure AD SSO, see Sign in with Azure AD. Windows 10 bulk enrollment With this release, KM now supports bulk enrollment of Windows 10 devices based on provisioning packages (PPKG). The process includes the following stages: Create PPKG, Deliver PPKG, Install PPKG, Install and Enroll KM Client Depending upon the purpose and specific customer needs, the IT admin can choose to assign one of three user types. The following image describes these three types: #Assign users ##Assign a default user To assign a user, do as follows: 1. In the KM console, go to Device Enrollment > Windows > Enrollment Setting > scroll to the User Assign section. 2. Specify whether the user is a default user or not by selecting a value for the Using Default User field: Yes - Choose this option if you want to assign this user as a default user for all appropriate devices. No - Choose this option if you do not want to assign this user as a default user. 3. Specify a value for the User ID field by clicking Select. On the dialog that opens, scroll to select the appropriate user ID. 4. Click Save to save your changes. ##Assign bulk users Bulk assignment of users is available as an option before you can assign a default user. To assign users in bulk, do as follows: Before you can use automatic assignment on devices, you must set the device name to the serial number. 1. In the KM console, go to Device Enrollment > Windows > Device Management > click Bulk Assign User. 2. In the Bulk Assign Users dialog that opens, click Download Template to download an Excel file that you can customize to include the appropriate user and device information. Ensure that the file you create has Digital Rights Management (DRM) disabled. Before you upload this Excel file, add the User ID you want to assign to the KM console. 3. Click !upload to select the appropriate file. 4. Click OK to upload the file to the KM console. ##Assign a single user You can assign a single user to each device after you've installed PPKG and enrolled the device in KM. To assign a single user to a device, do as follows: You can only assign a user to a device that is active and does not currently have a user assigned. 1. In the KM console, go to Device Enrollment > Windows > Device Management > scroll to the device to which you want to assign a user, and click the checkbox to select the device and then click Assign User. 2. In the Select User dialog that opens, click the User Name for the user you want to assign to the device. 3. Click OK to assign the user to the selected device. #Create PPKG You can create the PPKG using the Windows Configuration Designer (WCD) tool. To create the PPKG do as follows: 1. Download and install the Windows Configuration Designer tool from the Microsoft website. For information on how to install the WCD tool, see Microsoft documentation > Install the Windows Configuration Designer. 2. Use the PPKG information found on the KM console to create the PPKG file. You can find this information on the KM console on the Device Enrollment > > Windows > > Enrollment Setting > on the Bulk Enrollment page go to the Provisioning Package Reference section. #Deliver, enroll, and install the PPKG Once you create the PPKG, you can deliver it to your users either using a USB flash or another external drive, network drive, or as an email attachment. The device user then installs the PPKG file to their device from the Windows Settings > Access work or school > Add or Remove a provisioning package > Add a package. After the device users install the PPKG files on their devices, the Knox Manage client is automatically installed on the device and the device is enrolled to the KM console. Android Enterprise #MGP application track support With this release, KM includes the application track feature that supports the pre-release, closed testing of Managed Google Play applications. Once you create and release a custom, closed version of the MGP application in the Google Play Console, you can then assign this version to a group or organization in the KM admin console. To assign this version in the KM admin console, go to the Application menu, choose the apps you need, and then click Assign. #Cross-profile application support This release introduces a new cross-profile application support feature. If the same application exists in both the personal as well as the Work profiles, these two versions of the application can connect and access each other's data. This feature is only available if the application is added as a connected app with the `INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES` permission. To connect the two versions of the app, on the target device open Device Settings > Special access > Connected personal and work apps > enable for the appropriate app. #MGP app force update support IT admins can now push updates for MGP apps to target devices. To push the updates to devices, the devices must meet the following criteria: Connected to Wi-Fi, Plugged in and charging, Unused and idle, Not have the specified application running in the foreground In cases where devices do not meet these criteria, IT admins can push the update to the device at special intervals. When the update is pushed to the device, the app (if running on the device at the time) is terminated before the update is installed. #Chrome browser settings in MGP web app assignments A prerequisite for MGP web is the assignment of the Chrome browser on the target device. In cases where the device already has the Chrome browser app assigned to it, IT admins can choose to not assign the Chrome browser again when assigning a new MGP web app. For such devices, when assigning a new, additional MGP web app, IT admin can set the Chrome App Assignment field's value to No. #ICCID value support in managed configuration When setting up managed configurations for applications, a new field Integrated Circuit Card Identification Number (ICCID) is now available. ICCID is also added to the Open API's Get Device Detail screen. #Shared device improvements This release adds the following enhancements to the Shared Device feature. Secondary device information - The information available about secondary devices attached to the Shared Device is now available on the appropriate Group, Organization, Application, Profile, or Content Details pages. This information may include details such as whether the user is checked-in or checked-out and the staging username of the secondary user of the device. Send a device command to a secondary user - The IT admin can now send a device command to the secondary user of a device. To send the device command, go to the User or Group menu > Device Command. Staging device improvements - The Device List no longer includes information about the staging device's Profile not applied issue. Also, the staging device's name is now shown on the secondary user's device screen as well. iPadOS support Until this release, iOS 12 or lower was supported on all iPhone and iPad devices. Starting with this release, KM officially supports the new iPadOS for devices running iPadOS 13 or higher. The same details applicable to iOS devices also apply to devices running the new iPadOS. Reporting improvements Until KM 21.07, you could only enter search criteria for a report after the entire search results were shown. Going forward, when viewing a report, you are required to enter search conditions before you can view results of the search function. This way, you are shown results that meet your requirements without needing to weed through unnecessary information. Other enhancements and improvements The following enhancements and improvements are included in this release: Support for Polish language - This release adds support for the Polish language on the KM admin console as well as the KM agent. Add Device Commands for Service Admin - This release adds a new delete app data command for service admins. To access this option go to the Modify Administrator screen > Delete App Data. New OpenAPIs - The following new OpenAPIs are included: Purpose Method Path Parameter New response Get tags by device ID POST /emm/oapi/device/selectDeviceTagsByDeviceId deviceId Update device tags POST /emm/oapi/device/updateDeviceTags deviceId, tags Get device details POST /emm/oapi/device/selectDeviceInfo deviceId isRoaming, iccid, subscriberMcc, subscriberMncNa, currentMcc, currentMncName , Deleted devices list - You can now export the deleted devices list into .csv format and download it like other reports. Advanced search options for devices - The following new advanced search options are now available: OS version, Model name, and Firmware version. The OS version and model name list is shown based on the device pool of the tenant. Chromebook device management - Allow Chromebook management and setup through Knox Manage. IT admins can set up Browser, Network, and Printer settings on Chromebook devices. They can also specify settings such as allow or disallow screen capture, using SSO, location tracking, and so on. However, Chrome OS management is currently available only as early access to pre-approved users. Contact knoxmanage@samsung.com for approval. General availability will be announced separately in the near future.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Knox Manage 21.11 release notes. Knox Manage 21.11 is scheduled for release on November 18, 2021. This update includes new features and platform support, as well as many improvements and enhancements to existing features and functionality. Highlights , Android 12 location access, Android 12 password quality, Android Zero-touch page, Android export and import Managed Google Play app configurations, Windows app management support, Chromebook and Chrome OS support, iOS 15 support, Azure AD through the Graph API support, Report mailing, End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Android Enterprise The following changes apply to Android Enterprise device management. #Android 12 changes The following changes apply to devices running Android 12. ##Location access With Android 12 and higher, device users can decide whether to allow apps access to _approximate_ or _precise_ location data. Starting with KM 21.11, this affects location tracking on the following types of Android 12 deployments: Shared devices with a secondary account, Employee-owned devices with a work profile In order for the KM agent to properly report device location data on these devices, you must: Ask device users to grant Precise location data and select While using the app when the KM agent prompts them: Fully managed devices are unaffected. ##Enrollment identifiers To protect the hardware identity of employee-owned devices, Android 12 and higher doesn't share identifiers such as the serial number, IMEI, or MEID. As a result, KM 21.11 and higher can no longer read these identifiers from employee-owned devices. Devices previously enrolled through KM are unaffected, as their hardware identifiers have already been obtained. Going forward, KM associates a newly enrolled employee-owned device with a unique _enrollment identifier_ that persists across factory resets. Devices enrolled with the limited enrollment method also use an enrollment identifier. To view an employee-owned device's enrollment identifier on the KM console, go to Device > Device Detail > Device Information > Detail > Enrollment Specific ID. ##Password quality Android 12 and higher uses simplified parameters for password quality. Rather than providing multiple granular settings to guarantee password strength, the API uses _complexity_ levels - High, Medium, and Low. With KM 21.11 and higher, you can set the Password policy according to Android version: Android 12 and higher - Set the Minimum Complexity policy. Android 11 and lower - Assign granular settings in the Minimum Strength policy. If you use a single profile to manage the passwords of a mix of devices above and below Android 12, you must maintain both policies in that profile. The granular Password Lifecycle Settings policy common to Android 6 and higher is not affected. ##Screen capture Starting with Android 12 and higher, system apps built with certain API permissions can capture the screen even if the device has screen capturing disabled by an EMM (such as the System > Screen Capture policy on KM). This mostly affects preloaded system apps developed by device manufacturers. If you are unsure whether the preloaded apps on a deployed device have these permissions, you should verify with the device manufacturer. ##Work profile and token-based device enrollment Previously, token-based enrollment could only set up fully managed devices. With KM 21.11 and higher, the KM token can also set up a work profile. Before signing in to the KM agent for the first time, the device user is now prompted to choose Fully managed device or Work profile on company-owned device. #Zero-touch page KM 21.11 adds a dedicated page for a linked zero-touch enrollment account, under Device Enrollment > Zero Touch. The page is a frame for Google's zero-touch portal, through which you can add and manage your account from within the KM console. This addition makes zero-touch management more convenient, as you no longer need to manage the link between a zero-touch account and KM outside of the KM console. You can only register devices to zero-touch on the actual zero-touch portal. To navigate to the portal from the KM console, under Zero Touch click View devices in the zero-touch portal. To link a zero-touch account to your KM tenant: 1. Go to Device Enrollment > Zero Touch. 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to link to the zero-touch account. Once linked, the Zero Touch page displays the linked zero-touch account, its settings, and the URL to the device registration page on the zero-touch portal itself. #Export and import managed app configurations Previously, managed configurations for public Managed Google Play (MGP) apps could only be created on a per-assignment basis. Starting with KM 21.11, managed configurations can be exported and imported as CONFIG files for reuse. To export a MGP app's configuration: 1. Go to Applications, then click an app name. 2. Under the Assigned Group / Organization tab, choose an assignment to modify, then click See setting on the right. The assignment settings expand. 3. Next to Managed Configuration, click Export > !File Manager save the CONFIG file to your local system. To import a configuration into a MGP app: 1. Begin assigning a MGP app or modifying an existing assignment of an MGP app. 2. When configuring the assignment, click Managed Configuration > Set Configuration. 3. In the Managed Configuration dialog, import the configuration: 1. Enter a name for the managed configuration. 2. Click Import Configuration > !File Manager: Appx or APPXBUNDLE file format , MSIX or MSIXBUNDLE file format, Windows Installer (MSI): MSI file format ##Public apps Managed apps available on the Microsoft Store are referred to as _public apps_, which you can approve on a device profile, but only the device user can install. The updated KM agent has its own Application Store page, which the device user can browse for all managed public apps. When the user selects a managed app for installation, a deep link takes them to the app's page on the Microsoft Store. From there, they can install it like normal. ##Add and assign apps The steps to add and apply Windows apps are very similar to the steps for Android and iOS. Go to Application > Add, then for Platform select Windows. Then, select: Internal - For internal apps available directly through the KM agent: UWP app - Upload the app as an APPX, APPXBUNDLE, MSIX, or MSIXBUNDLE file to the KM console. MSI app - Upload the app as a MSI file to the console. Public - For public apps available on the Microsoft Store: Link to the app's page on the Microsoft Store. #Application Store on KM agent With the introduction of Windows app management, we have updated the KM agent to allow for Windows app installation. The new Application Store section in the interface contains three new pages that allow device users to download, install, and remove managed apps: All - Browse all managed apps. Installed - View managed apps that have been installed. Categories - Browse managed apps by category. Chrome OS With Knox Manage 21.11, Chrome OS and Chromebook management is in early access for pre-approved users. Contact for approval. General availability will be announced separately in the near future. For approved users, the KM console can now manage and enroll Chromebooks and Chrome OS apps. Like with Android devices, the KM agent for Chromebooks is available on Google Play. The following changes apply to Chromebook management. #Set up Chromebook management Before you can begin managing Chromebooks, you must set up your Google Admin Console and KM: 1. First, you need to upgrade your Chrome license: 1. Depending on which license you have, purchase the Chrome Enterprise Upgrade or Chrome Education Upgrade from your Knox reseller or the Google Admin Console. 2. Next, you need to set up an organization and users: 1. On the Google Admin console, create an organization and users. 2. Register at least one Chromebook with the organization. 3. Lastly, register the Google admin account with KM: 1. On the KM console, go to Setting > Chrome OS > Sign in with Google. The Google accounts page opens. 2. Log in to the Google account. 3. Select all permissions, then click Continue. The browser returns you to the KM console. The Google Authorization Code field is now filled in. 4. Enter the same account for the Google Admin Email Address, then click Authorize. Once set up, all the users, Chromebooks, and policies for each organization synchronize with KM. #Chrome OS management overview Chrome OS and Chromebook management on KM relies on a link between the managed services on the Google Admin console and the KM console. Due to this fact, there are some important differences you should keep in mind when managing Chrome OS and Chromebooks compared to the other supported OSs on KM: Automatic syncing - Organizations, users, and devices are synced from the Google Admin console. You cannot create new organizations or users from the KM console. Organization-based deployment - Devices can only be assigned to organizations. Groups are not supported. Organization-based profiles - Each organization has an automatically-generated profile associated with it. To set policies for deployments, you must edit the associated profile. You cannot create additional profiles. User-based enrollment - Each user account is associated with a Chromebook. Currently, the User & Browser and App & Extension policies are available. Support for Device policies is planned for a future release. Here is a quick overview of how to manage Chromebooks and Chrome OS apps on KM. View organization details - You can view information about all organizations synced from Google services. Go to Organization, then set Type to Google. The list filters for all organizations synced from Google. Click an organization to view its details. View user details - You can view information about all users synced from Google services. Go to Users, then set Type to Google. The list filters for all users synced from Google. Click a user to view their information. Manage Chromebooks - You can view information about the Chromebooks synced from Google services. Go to Device, then set Platform and Mgmt. Type to Chrome OS. The list filters for Chromebooks synced from Google. From this page, you can: Factory reset devices , Unenroll devices , Send lock or unlock device commands , Clear user profiles , Click a device to view its details: Manage profiles for Chromebooks - For each organization synced from Google services, a matching default profile is created on KM. You cannot delete this default profile, but you can modify it to meet your management needs, and then push it to the Google Admin console. Subsequently, any updates to the profile and policies apply to enrolled Chromebooks. To view Chromebook profiles, go to Profile, then set Platform to Chrome OS. Click a profile to edit its policies. #Manage Chrome OS apps KM can now manage Chrome OS apps and Chrome extensions. Like with other supported OSs, managed apps are divided between public and internal sources. There are three app types, each with different methods for adding them: Managed Google Play - Add an app through an iframe of Google Play on the KM console, the same way you add managed apps in Android. Even though both Android and Chrome OS use the same app store, you can't create one app configuration and assign it to both types of devices - you'll need to manage a separate app configuration for each. ID - Add an app or a Chrome browser extension by entering a valid identifier from Google Play or the Chrome Web store. To obtain an identifier, see Get Chrome app or extension IDs. URL - Add an app by entering its URL. Adding a managed app in the KM console does not add it to the Google Admin console. #Assign apps Unlike other supported OSs, you can only assign Chrome OS apps to organizations. Group assignment is not supported. To assign an app to an organization: 1. Go to Organization. 2. Choose one or more organizations, then click Application. 3. Choose the apps you want to assign, then click Assign > Application. #Set profiles and policies Like with other supported OSs, a Chrome OS profile and its policies control the settings and behavior of enrolled Chromebooks. Access an organization's profile by clicking it on the Profile page. Then, click Modify Policy: On the Set Policy page, you can set: 1. Chrome (User & Browser) policies, which apply to the user account and the system's main Chrome browser. Chrome (Apps) policies, which apply to apps. Due to restrictions in the Chrome OS API, there is no policy to control access to Google Play. iOS The following changes apply to iOS device management. #iOS 15 support KM 21.11 and higher supports devices running iOS 15. #Allowed Wi-Fi networks policy addition With iOS 14.5 and higher, a supervised device can have its Wi-Fi restricted to an SSID allowlist. You can use this feature to better provision and control the network access of enrolled devices. With KM 21.11 and higher you can enable this feature as a policy under Interface > Connect Wi-Fi To Allowed Networks Only: #App contact sharing policy additions In iOS, by default, managed and unmanaged apps can't share contact data, so sensitive or private contact information isn't exposed to potentially insecure apps. With iOS 12 and higher, exceptions can be granted so that managed and unmanaged apps can share contacts. KM 21.11 adds two policies that provide for these exceptions: Application > Managed Apps to Write Contacts to Unmanaged Contacts Accounts - Managed apps can save contact data to the unmanaged Contacts app. Application > Unmanaged Apps to Read Contacts from Managed Contacts Accounts - Unmanaged apps can read contact data stored in managed apps. #Device restriction policy additions The following device restriction policies, which provide additional security and access control, are new with KM 21.11: Exchange > Override Previous Password - Overrides the previous user and EAS password with the new EAS password. Supported on iOS 14 and higher devices. Exchange > Control Calendar/Contacts/Mail/Reminder App: Enable App - Automatically configure the Calendar, Control, Mail, and Reminder apps to use the Exchange user account for the Calendar, Control, Mail, and Reminder apps, respectively. At least one app must be enabled. Allow User to Change - Lets the device user configure the app's user account. Network Usage Rules > Sim Network Settings - Enables Wi-Fi Assist based on the SIM card identifier (ICCID). You can add multiple SIMs as needed. Use Default System enables Wi-Fi Assist, letting OS switch to using cellular data when Wi-Fi signal strength is poor. Use Cellular Data forces cellular data use at all times. Supported on iOS 13 and higher devices. Wi-Fi > MAC Randomization - Randomizes the device's MAC address when connected to the Wi-Fi network. Supported on iOS 14 and higher devices. WebClip > Full Screen - Opens the Web Clip as a web app without browser features - no navigation buttons, address bar, search bar, or bookmark features. This option is similar to full-screen mode in a web browser. App Lock > Options > Voice Control - Allows the device to be controlled with Siri voice commands. When enabled, the device user cannot turn off voice control. Knox services The following changes integrate recent enhancements to other Knox services. #Sub-admin self-registration As part of our effort to unify the Knox platform, sub-admins from other Knox cloud services in your organization can now register themselves as KM sub-admins with one click. On the Knox Portal, sub-admins will see Join on the Discover more > Knox Manage card. Clicking the card will register them as a KM sub-admin. On the KM console, on the Setting > Administrator page, you can see that automatically registered sub-admins have an administrator ID, which consists of their Knox customer ID and the local-part of their email. For example, a sub-admin with the ID 5482734812 and the email admin1@example.com would become 5482734812_admin1. By default, automatically-registered sub-admin accounts start with read-only permissions. #MSP-related audit log additions Starting with 21.11, KM logs the following new types of events in the MSP category: MSP scenario Action Event description Migration Approve Migration requested is approved on KM Migration requested is approved on AMS Reject Migration requested is rejected on KM Migration requested is rejected on AMS Delink Approve Delink requested is approved on KM Delink requested is approved on AMS Reject Delink requested is rejected on KM Delink requested is rejected on AMS Change access permission Access permission is changed from No Access to Full Access Knox Remote Support #Knox Remote Support name change To improve naming consistency with other Knox services, all instances of the term \"Remote Support\" have been changed in the console, Web Viewer, and Agent: Previous term , New term - , - Remote Support , Knox Remote Support KM Remote Support , Knox Remote Support Knox Manage Remote Support , Knox Remote Support #Staging users on shared devices Knox Remote Support is now available for staging users on shared devices. It is unavailable for secondary users. To install the Knox Remote Support Agent as a staging user: 1. On the KM agent, select Service Desk > Download Remote Support App. The app starts downloading and installing. 2. After installation, select Run Remote Support App. #File browser The following enhancements and changes were made to the file browser: The session's downloads now appear in the download manager at the bottom of the browser, instead of the File Download Progress bar. You can now view transferred files by clicking Detail next to them. Transferring folders is no longer supported. #Other changes , Removed support for the PC Viewer app. Instead, the Web Viewer service should be used on a web browser. When recording a screen capture session, the file name uses the browser's date and time, rather than the KM server's. Knox Browser The following changes apply to Knox Browser. #Galaxy Tab Book Cover keyboard support On Galaxy Tab series devices, the Knox Browser now recognizes input from a paired Book Cover keyboard. #Navigation button location The Knox Browser navigation buttons now sit on either side of the address bar. This resolves an issue where the home button could become hidden. #Page scroll with active keyboard When the device user brings up the keyboard on the Knox Browser, they can now scroll the page by swiping above the keyboard. This resolves an issue where the keyboard blocked the page from scrolling. Azure AD Sync Service based on Graph API Starting with KM 21.11, a new active directory (AD) integration is available - Azure AD through the Graph API. This method currently supports user and group syncing. Only one Azure AD sync service is allowed per KM tenant. To configure the Azure AD integration, fill the form under Advanced > Azure AD Integration: Mobile content management The following changes apply to the Mobile Content Management (MCM) feature of KM. #Automatic content reassignment Previously, assigned content on a device would not update if the device itself was reassigned. As of KM 21.11, when you transfer a user to another group or organization, or you transfer a device to another group, any differences in assigned content are synced. Content assigned to the previous group/organization is deleted from the device, and content assigned to the new group/organization is downloaded. Kiosk The following changes apply to kiosk device management. #Language and time zone device settings For Kiosk mode, KM 21.11 adds settings to control whether device users can modify the device's time zone and language. Enable these settings under: Multi-app Kiosk - Advanced Setting > Device Setting > Time Zone and Language, Single-app Kiosk - Device Setting > Time Zone and Language Reports The following changes apply to the report feature of KM. #Report mailing With 21.11, reports have a new feature - report mailing. You can schedule an automated email containing a report's information to KM admins. Each email links to an Excel spreadsheet of the report that is available for download for 7 days. The downloads are authenticated with a one-time password sent by SMS. Email frequency can be daily, weekly, or monthly. Up to 10 reports can be scheduled. To preserve system performance and stability, the following reports are not available for scheduling:, App Information Installed in Device, Device Location To schedule a report for emailing: 1. Go to Advanced > Report, then click Report Mailing Settings. 2. Click Add. 3. Complete the Add Report Schedule form: 1. Schedule Name - A unique name for the schedule. 2. Period - The time interval during which the reports are emailed. 3. Frequency - How often to email the report. Choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. 4. Report - The report to email. 5. Sent To - The KM admins who receive the emails. #Parent organization name in report queries Report queries that contain organization information now include the parent organization name in the Organization Path field. This helps you identify the hierarchy of organizations in reports. The following query types support this field: User Basic Information, Device Basic Information, Device Detail Information Other changes #End of support for Internet Explorer 11 Microsoft announced that they will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) on June 15, 2022. In preparation for this, as of 21.11 (November 18, 2021), the KM console should no longer be accessed on IE11. The KM console is best viewed in Edge, Chrome, or Firefox. #New information on device maps KM has enhanced information presented in the device map on device location pages. Hovering over a device shows the following new details: User Name, Last Location Scanned, Tag, Platform & Management Type, Model Name Additionally, devices that have violated KeepAlive settings now appear as red pins. #GPX export for multiple devices The GPX export feature now supports exporting multiple devices at once. A separate GPX file exports per device. To export GPX files for multiple devices: 1. Go to Device, then select multiple devices. 2. Click Check Location > Export to GPX. Choose a location on your system to save the GPX files. #New service admin permissions To enable greater admin flexibility, you can now grant service admins the following permissions: 1. Unenroll & Force Unenroll Device 2. Delete Unenrolled Device #Add license name field To account for scenarios where the name of an MSP license changes, the KM console now supports changing the License Name field. This field is now required. #Apply latest profile and sub-organizations When you apply the latest profile ( Organization > Apply Latest Profile ), the profile now applies to any sub-organizations that are children of the organization. #Bulk user registration enhancements , The bulk user spreadsheet template has been updated to include a Group Name column. It is not a required field. If you submit a bulk user spreadsheet with invalid Group Name or Organization Code fields, the KM console throws an error message. It no longer registers the affected users into an undefined group. #Miscellaneous enhancements Finally, with 21.11, KM has received the following simple enhancements.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Knox Manage 22.05 release notes. Minimum supported Android version As of 22.05, the minimum supported Android version in Knox Manage is Android 6 (Knox 2.6). In order to meet the minimum requirements of Knox Manage, you should upgrade any devices in your fleet running older Android versions to Android 6 or higher. As a reminder, the support plan for Android will undergo further change to comply with the overall support strategy of Knox cloud services. Starting in 2024, Knox Manage will support a range of Android versions that starts from the latest major version and covers the five major versions before it. TLS deprecation Starting with 22.08, in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Knox Manage will no longer support TLS 1.0 and 1.1. To keep your devices enrolled and managed in Knox Manage, please make sure that they're running Android 6 or higher by the time of the 22.08 release. Enhancement of Account Blocklist policy for Android Previously, you could only restrict modifying accounts on an Android device by configuring a blocklist with the Account Blocklist policy. This release expands the policy to restrict account modification either by an allowlist or blocklist, depending on your deployment needs and strategy. The policy is now called Account Block/Allowlist. You can add and remove accounts to this list as before. Managed Google Play accounts can't be modified, so adding them to the allowlist has no effect. For more details, see Account Block/Allowlist on the Android Enterprise policies reference. Automatic Wi-Fi connection for Android This release adds an Automatic Connection setting to Wi-Fi configurations in an Android profile. When enabled, this setting forces the device to set the configured network as default and connect to it when Wi-Fi is turned on. When disabled, the network configuration is pushed to the device, but the user chooses which networks to connect to. Managed Google Play account creation improvements Previously, Android devices created the Managed Google Play (MGP) account after the Knox Manage agent finished setting up. During out-of-the-box enrollment of Fully Managed devices and company-owned devices with a Work Profile, it was possible that the MGP account could fail to create. Starting with Knox Manage 22.05, during enrollment of these types of devices, the MGP account is created when the device is registered in Knox Manage. Since this change to the flow guarantees that the account is created, it could save you considerable time when deploying out-of-the-box devices with MGP apps. Knox Service Plugin Wi-Fi configuration improvements for Android For situations where Wi-Fi configurations defined by the Knox Service Plugin policy are removed from a device, Knox Manage 22.05 adds two new options to restore them: Reapply KSP Wi-Fi configurations command to the device. On the Knox Manage agent, the device user can restore the configuration by tapping Reapply KSP Wi-Fi Configurations. Day & time event type for AMAPI profiles With Knox Manage 22.05, the Android Management API (AMAPI) profiles now support the Day & Time event, which schedules when to apply and update the profile on target devices. iOS policy additions The following new iOS policies are available in Knox Manage 22.05: System:, Force on device only dictation (Siri), Force on device only translation (Siri), Wrist detection on Apple watch, Apple personalized advertising, Wallpaper modification, Notification modification, New device proximity setup, Unpaired external boot to recovery, Interface > NFC, Share > Managed pasteboard, Security > Auto unlock with Apple watch, Phone > Cellular plan modification Skip setting additions for iOS DEP setup For devices enrolled through the Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP), Knox Manage 22.05 adds the option to skip the following screens in the setup flow: Appearance, App Store, Device to Device Migration, Messaging Activation Using Phone Numbe, Restore Completed, Terms and Conditions, Update Completed, Welcome Improvements to DEP device enrollment Previously, the Knox Manage agent installed automatically to DEP devices during enrollment. However, there were some cases where automatic installation failed, and if the device user manually installed and authenticated the Knox Manage agent afterward, Knox Manage didn't recognize the device as belonging to the DEP. To prevent this issue going forward, with Knox Manage 22.05 you can now install the Knox Manage agent to devices by adding and assigning it as a Volume Purchase Program app. For more details, see Manage VPP applications. Temporary session history for Shared iPads Previously, the session history for an iPad, viewable on the Device Detail > Shared Device > Shared Device User tab, didn't keep records of temporary sessions. With 22.05, Knox Manage now records a history of temporary sessions in each Shared iPad's session history. Improvements to app installation policies for iOS Previously, setting the App Block/Allowlist Settings policy would block the App Installation policy for all devices, preventing its use. With 22.05, you can now apply both policies at the same time to supervised devices running iOS 13 and higher. App improvements for Chrome OS kiosks Starting with Knox Manage 22.05, you can view all kiosk apps available for your Chrome OS devices on the new Kiosk Application tab on the Organization Detail page. The tab lists all the Chrome OS kiosks in your organization, and has two actions: Auto-Launch App - Sets the selected app to be the default app for all kiosks in the organization. Cancel Auto-Launch App - Unsets the selected app to be the default app for all kiosks in the organization. Privacy Policy in Knox Remote Support agent In accordance with several data protection and privacy laws, including GDPR and LGPD, this release adds a Privacy Policy consent dialog to the Knox Remote Support agent. In order for the device user to run the Knox Remote Support agent on a device and receive assistance from a support provider, they must first consent to the Privacy Policy. Managed Samsung devices don't require consent when the device user first launches Knox Remote Support, because consent was already obtained when the device was enrolled with a Knox license. Kiosk bookmark improvements Previously, home screen bookmarks on kiosks would open in the Android Webview app instead of a web browser, even if a browser was installed. Android Webview can view basic web pages, but has limited capabilities in viewing video and other rich content. Starting with this release, the first time a device user taps a home screen bookmark, the kiosk prompts them to open it with any installed browser app. They can choose to always open bookmarks using that app. In order for this behavior to function correctly: At least one web browser, such as Samsung Internet, must be installed on the kiosk. The web browser should be allowlisted as locktask apps. Knox Suite license updates for Wi-Fi only Android tablets Previously, Wi-Fi only Android tablets released before 2019 would enroll in Knox Manage with 16-digit serial numbers, when their serial numbers are actually only 11 digits long. This discrepancy caused an issue where if an affected tablet had a Knox Suite license in both Knox Manage and another Knox cloud service, then the license was consumed multiple times because the 11-digit and 16-digit serial numbers both contributed toward the consumption count. Knox Manage 22.05 corrects this discrepancy, and any newly enrolled Wi-Fi only Android tablet registers its correct 11-digit serial number. You can update the serial numbers of affected tablets that were enrolled prior to 22.05 by sending them the Update License device command. API updates The Knox Manage API 22.05 has the following changes: New operation - Get Device Detail By Google Device Id , Queries the detailed information of a device by sending its Google Device ID. Updates to operations: Get Device List and Get User List - Added the updatedAfter argument, which is an ISO8601 date string that specifies the earliest point to look for changes to the device/user status. Unenroll Device - Improved to work for devices with Work Profiles. For more details about these changes, see the Knox Manage API reference. Email alert enhancements Knox Manage 22.05 makes the following changes to profile-based email alerts: Frequency and Time settings - Specify how often and what time of day to send alerts. Re-enrolled Devices after factory reset alert - An alert that indicates the device was re-enrolled after it was factory reset. Token Expiration and Certificate Expiration alerts - Click !bell > Notification Mailing Settings to enable email alerts for when tokens (for APNs, VPP, DEP, and so on) and certificates expire in your tenant. The alerts trigger 30 days prior to the expiration. Applied profile version In Knox Manage 22.05, you can now view the version of the profile applied to a device: On the Device tab of the Profile Detail page, you can click See Policy to view every policy applied to the device, and which version of the profile applied each policy. From that dialog, you can also click Export to Excel to save the profile policies and versions as tabular data to an XLSX file. On the Profile tab of the Device Detail page, you can view every policy applied to the device, and which version of the profile applied each policy. Miscellaneous changes The following miscellaneous changes come with Knox Manage 22.05: The Knox Remote Support agent now requires additional permissions to run on Android devices. After the agent updates, the next time it runs, the device user is presented with a one-time prompt for these permissions. In order to provide support to your device users, you should instruct them to grant these permissions when they're prompted. If your tenant has only one super admin, you can no longer change their permissions to those of a sub-admin. When you delete a DEP device from Knox Manage, Apple Business Manager no longer automatically adds the device back to Knox Manage.

            "content": "Knox Manage 22.08 release notes. Unless indicated otherwise, the term _Android_ on this page refers to the Android Enterprise platform. TLS Deprecation In compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, as of 22.08 Knox Manage no longer supports TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Usability changes for Managed Google Play apps In March 2022, Google announced that they would replace the legacy Google Play EMM, which many EMMs implement for configuring enterprise-level Managed Google Play (MGP) app stores. Switching to the newer API in 22.08 has resulted in several significant changes across the Knox Manage experience for both IT admins and device users: All three app types - MGP public, MGP private, and MGP web - now have the same management flows on the Knox Manage console by way of the Google Play iframe. The old flow for approving an app in the Google Play iframe, which involved multiple approval steps, has been replaced by a one-click action. For the purposes of categorizing apps on the MGP store on devices, the Advanced Store Layout on the Knox Manage console has been replaced with Google Play's built-in functionality for organizing app collections. Adding the Knox Service Plugin app now requires only one click. If the device user removes a public app that you deployed through Knox Manage, you can no longer reinstall it by re-issuing the Install or Update App device command. Instead, make sure its Installation Type is set to Automatic (Non-removable) during assignment, then, if the app is uninstalled, send the Apply Latest Profiles command. Installed MGP apps can only be updated automatically, based on a schedule set by the Auto Update Mode setting when the app is assigned. The Update to the Latest Version button on an app's details no longer forces an app to update on devices - it now merely reminds you that the app will adhere to the auto-update schedule. For updated descriptions of the flows for adding and assigning MGP apps, refer to Assign Managed Google Play apps and Add apps using Managed Google Play. Updates to lock reset sequence on Android Previously, the order of operations to reset the lock on an Android device involved setting a temporary password and relaying it to the device user. This sequence posed some security risk, because the device user could continue to use the temporary password without setting a new lock. Starting with 22.08, the device user can no longer keep the temporary password on Android 8 and higher devices. After the lock is reset by the Reset Screen Password command, they must set a new lock before they can continue operating the device. Improvements to Custom Wallpaper policy on Android This release improves the recently-added Custom Wallpaper policy: When the policy is unset, the original wallpaper is restored. The custom wallpaper correctly rotates when the device switches to landscape display mode. Support for detailed APN settings in Android policies The Android Enterprise APN policy group has been greatly extended with new APN parameters as sub-policies: APN Protocol, APN Roaming Protocol, Mobile virtual network operator type, Bearer Fix for version status of beta Android apps Previously, an app's Version field on the Application Detail page was blank if the app had the beta attribute on Google Play. Starting with 22.08, the detail page correctly reports the version of apps in beta. App tracks for Android apps When assigning an Android app, if you set it to install automatically, you can now also choose to put it on an app track through the Use App Track settings. Android policy additions The new App Prevented from Using Mobile Data Setting policy allows you to prevent individual apps from using mobile data. This policy is supported on devices running Android 10 and higher. Knox Manage agent on Shared iPad With this release, the Knox Manage agent is now supported on Shared iPads. Like with other supported device platforms, the agent provides an interface where device users in your enterprise can install recommended or optional apps in the course of business. For the 22.08 release, internal apps and apps assigned through the Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) are supported in the store. Similar to other apps for Shared iPad, you assign and automatically install the agent through the VPP. Once installed, managed device users can access the agent to install internal and VPP apps, while guest users in temporary sessions can't. Additionally, when the Knox Manage agent is deployed, you can configure a Day & Time event for the iOS profile. Device commands for Knox Manage agent on Shared iPad Coming in sync with the support for the Knox Manage agent, Shared iPads can now receive device commands when an active Managed Apple ID session is in progress. When the agent is installed on the device, the commands are available during these sessions on the Shared Device tab of the Device Detail page. For 22.08, the following commands are available during these sessions: Application > Apply Latest Internal App Information , Device Info > Collect Current Location , Knox Manage > , Push Notification , Update User Information , Lock Screen of Knox Manage Agent , Unlock Knox Manage Agent , Collect Audit Log , Collect Device Log , Collect Diagnosis Information Extension of managed app settings for public iOS apps Beginning with Knox Manage 22.08, you can configure managed values (key-value pairs) for public iOS apps in addition to private apps. See Add public apps using iOS App Store for more details. iOS policy additions The following new iOS policies are available in Knox Manage 22.08. These policies primarily concern the restriction of core Apple services and technologies: System > , Keyboard shortcuts , Predictive keyboard , Application > , Apple news , Apple music radio , Apple podcasts , Find friends , Find my device , Share > , AirPrint , AirPrint credentials storage , Force AirPrint trusted TLS requirement , AirPrint iBeacon discovery , iCloud > , Enterprise book backup , Enterprise books, notes and highlights sync Samsung Knox Manage on the Azure AD app gallery for cloud-based MDM Previously, the Knox Manage app was only available on the Azure portal as an on-premises app. This release adds the Samsung Knox Manage app to the Azure AD app gallery in the Mobility (MDM and MAM) category, making it available as a cloud or SaaS MDM app for Azure AD tenants. This cloud-based MDM provides the same capabilities as its on-premises counterpart, those being easily syncing user and group information with Knox Manage based on the Microsoft Graph API, and enrollment for Windows devices. For instructions on how to migrate to the new app, see Sync user information with Azure AD through Microsoft Graph API. Improvements to Azure AD integration flow With the addition of the Samsung Knox Manage cloud/SaaS MDM app to the Azure portal, you no longer need to configure Azure AD with Knox Manage as an on-premises sync service. The Azure AD Integration page on the Knox Manage console has consequently been revamped to require only a directory ID, without an app ID or the other on-premises information. This improvement significantly cuts down on configuration and confirmation time when bridging Azure AD with Knox Manage. Learn about the simplified procedure in Sync user information with Azure AD through Microsoft Graph API. Support for Azure AD registered and Azure AD joined devices With 22.08, devices provisioned through the Knox Manage app in Azure AD now comply as Azure AD registered and Azure AD joined devices: Azure AD registered devices are BYOD devices such as employee-owned laptops and phones, and connect the user to Azure AD. The user account is provisioned through their Windows account. Azure AD joined devices are company-owned devices such as work laptops, and connect the user to Azure AD. The account is provisioned through the user's Windows account, a Windows provisioning PPKG, Windows Out of Box Experience, or Windows Autopilot. For complete details, as well as instructions on how to enroll these types of Windows devices, refer to the new page Enroll a Windows device with Entra ID. Windows policy additions The following new Windows policies are available in Knox Manage 22.08: System > , Date and Time , Language , Power and Sleep , Region , Workplace , Account , Windows Sync , Windows Tips , Interface > , Device Bluetooth Advertising , Cortana , IME Logging , IME Network Access , Location > Location App types for Chrome OS Different apps that you make available to the Chromebooks in your fleet can have different deployment scopes and user experiences. For example, some apps are functionally equivalent to Chrome browser extensions, while others might not be compatible with managed guest sessions. To ease understanding of the various Chrome OS apps that you may manage in your enterprise, the Knox Manage console adds a new way of classifying them, called a _type_. Types help you discern the scope and compatibility of an app, and are displayed on the Application Detail page. They differ from categories in that they are automatically generated and aren't managed by admins. The Chrome OS app types are: Users & browsers - Apps that are compatible with regular user sessions, comprising standard Chrome OS apps, Android apps, and web apps. Kiosks - Apps that are compatible with kiosk mode, comprising standard Chrome OS apps and web apps. Managed guest sessions - Apps that are compatible with managed guest sessions, comprising standard Chrome OS apps and web apps. App types are determined in combination by Google and the app developer. Since an app can evolve over time, its type may change from time to time. Support for managed guest session apps with Chrome OS Knox Manage can now assign apps designed for managed guest session devices. Simply select Managed guest sessions as the app type during assignment. This app type is organized into its own section of the Organization Detail page, on a tab called Managed Guest Session Application. From there, you can edit an app's assignment settings by selecting the app and clicking Modify Setting. Chrome OS policy additions The following new Chrome OS policies are available in Knox Manage 22.08: Kiosks > Kiosk settings > , Kiosk device status alerting delivery , Kiosk device status alerting contact info , URL blocking , Kiosk virtual keyboard features (websites only) , Kiosks > Kiosk power settings > , Action on lid close , AC Kiosk power settings , Battery Kiosk power settings , Kiosks > Kiosk accessibility > , Kiosk floating accessibility menu , Kiosk spoken feedback , Kiosk select to speak , Kiosk high contrast , Kiosk sticky keys , Kiosk on-screen keyboard , Kiosk dictation , Kiosk keyboard focus highlighting , Kiosk caret highlight , Kiosk auto-click enabled , Kiosk large curso , Kiosk cursor highlight , Kiosk primary mouse button , Kiosk mono audio , Kiosk accessibility shortcuts , Kiosk screen magnifie , Managed guest sessions > General > Managed guest session Kiosks with auto-launching apps are mutually incompatible with managed guest sessions. To ensure continuous availability of your kiosks, do not set the Managed guest session policy to Allow managed guest session if your kiosks are set to auto-launch apps. Chrome OS device command additions Knox Manage 22.08 adds two new device commands for Chrome OS kiosks that are configured to auto-launch apps: Kiosk > , Set Volume , Take a Screenshot Screenshots taken with the Take a Screenshot command are stored on Google's servers and can be accessed on the Device Information tab of the Device Detail page. Click and _\\#_ more to download the screenshots. Knox Remote Support changes In addition to changes to Knox Manage, the 22.08 release also brings improvements to Knox Remote Support. View these changes in the Knox Admin Portal 22.08 release notes. Support for camera and audio recording on the Knox Browser and the Kiosk Browser Websites on the Knox Browser and the Kiosk Browser can now capture audio and video data from internal microphones and webcams. In more recent OS versions across supported platforms, the device user must grant hardware access permissions to the browser before it can capture audio and video. Older OS versions might not require user consent. Group and organization reports With this release, you can now generate reports of group and organization information in your tenant. These report types contain detailed information, including but not limited to: User account emails, User names, Organization entities (members, profiles, apps, content) API updates The Knox Manage API 22.08 has the following changes: New operation - sendDeviceControlForSyncInstalledAppList, Separation of permission levels - When adding an API client, you can now restrict the client's permission by setting it as read-only. Read-only clients can only run the GET method of an operation. With this change, all existing clients have been granted full permissions in order to prevent regression. Improvement to Knox Suite tenant setup Previously, all IT admins who created a Knox Manage tenant using a Knox Suite license were forced to configure Android Enterprise settings, even if they had no intention of managing Android devices. Beginning with Knox Manage 22.08, you can now skip configuring the Android Enterprise settings during the initial tenant setup. Support for secondary IMEI on dual-SIM devices Previously, Knox Manage wouldn't report the secondary IMEI (IMEI2) of dual-SIM devices on the console. Device search, device lists, and device detail pages on the console, as well as exported reports now support queries for a device's secondary IMEI. If a dual-SIM device returns only one IMEI, the IMEI is denoted by either IMEI1 or IMEI2, depending on which SIM slot the card occupies on the device. Any dual-SIM device that you upload to your tenant after release day will immediately register its IMEI2, if the identifier is available. However, it will take additional time on the Knox back end to gather the IMEI2s of all dual-SIM devices that were uploaded before release day. The anticipated completion date for gathering all IMEI2s is September 1, 2022, PDT. Export device security code in spreadsheet file When exporting device lists as CSV files, you can now choose to include the following sensitive administrative information, if applicable: Unlock code, Unenrollment code, Exit kiosk code To incorporate this information, when you click Export to CSV, select Include additional security code when prompted. Improvements to device lists With the aim of enhancing your ability to filter device information, 22.08 brings the following changes to device lists: On the Group Detail > Device and Organization Detail > Device pages, you can enable or disable any column by clicking !settings > Columns, and then selecting a column. Click Revert Column Settings to revert the visibility of all columns to default. On the Device page, when performing an advanced search, you can now filter for particular models by typing values into the Model Name field, which speeds up the time it takes to select one. Improvements to profile history The following changes were made to profile functionality in Knox Manage 22.08: When saving changes to an existing profile, a new Profile Version Update dialog prompts you to provide an optional message that describes the change, as well as shows the profile version number you're about to save. Previously, you could only access the profile history by clicking See History on the Profile Detail page. That button is now available on the main Profile page, too. Miscellaneous changes Lastly, Knox Manage receives the following miscellaneous changes in the 22.08 release: If the Knox Manage agent fails to install an app on a device, the agent status in the notification drawer now displays the app's package name. For example, com.google.android.apps.maps. The Weekly trend is removed from the Device Command History histogram on the dashboard. The histogram now only shows the Daily trend. Android Legacy policy deprecation for 22.11 release With the deprecation of the Google EMM API, the Knox Manage team plans to deprecate the Show ProgressBar when Installing Apps Android Legacy policy in the 22.11 release. As a general reminder to users, in accordance with its platform support strategy, Knox Manage will also sunset support for Android 6 in Q1 2023. For complete information about this plan, see Policy update on Knox supported versions on the Samsung Knox blog. Back to release notes",

            "content": "Knox Manage 22.11 release notes. Notice regarding upcoming changes to platform support As a general reminder to all customers and users, Knox Manage will sunset support for the oldest versions of Android and iOS in Q1 2023. As of 23.03, Knox Manage will support: Android 8 and higher, up from 6, iOS 14 and higher, up from 11 Furthermore, Android Legacy will be deprecated as a platform in 23.03. Management of devices using this platform may continue to function in the near future, but official development and customer support won't be provided by Samsung teams from that release onward. We strongly recommend you migrate all devices using the Android Legacy platform to Android Enterprise. For more information about the platform support plan of all Knox cloud services, see Policy update on Knox supported versions on the Samsung Knox blog. Support for Android 13 Knox Manage now supports enrolling and managing devices running Android 13. Knox Manage agent notification permission in Android 13 Due to progressive privacy improvements in Android 13, after an Android 13 device is enrolled with a work profile, the Knox Manage agent requires permission from the device user to display notifications in the personal profile. As a brief reminder, the sole notification that the agent pushes after enrollment is a reminder to remove the agent itself. If the device user denies the permission, then they can still remove the agent from the personal profile manually. Non-shared fully managed Android devices Based on customer feedback, the Knox Manage team has implemented a new method of preparing a device for enrollment, called _non-shared_. You can consider it as a special enrollment method, like Knox Mobile Enrollment, that's unique to fully managed devices. The purpose of non-shared mode is to configure and enroll the device with a staging user, like a regular shared device, and then seamlessly transfer it to the actual user by transforming it into a fully managed device. Once the transformation takes place, the device can't be reverted to its non-shared state. Because the majority of the configuration and enrollment activities take place when the device is in the admin's possession, this new method minimizes disruption of the device user in demanding on-premises environments where they aren't equipped, capable, or free to enroll the device on their own. During setup, a non-shared device is like a typical shared device intended for a single business purpose, except it's destined to be operated by only one user. Like shared devices, a non-shared device receives a basic configuration and a staging user for testing and administration, and applies a profile payload when an assigned user account starts a session. You can pre-load content and apps to the device, so long as you assign them to the group of the user account intended for enrollment. For the initial release of this feature, a subset of Android Enterprise device commands is available. Check the Supported system column in the reference to see which apply. Improvements to shared and non-shared Android devices With the aim of enabling the non-shared setup mode and supplementing the feature set of regular shared devices, the following changes are made to the staging device experience and flows on the console: You can now prepare Wi-Fi access point configurations so that shared and non-shared devices can connect to on-premises networks out of the box. In the profile of a staging user, you can now choose between Shared Device and Non-shared Device to specify the device's intended user provisioning. The Setting > Configuration > Staging & Shared Device page is renamed to Staging Device. Google server connection test To assist you in assessing sync issues with Google's servers when your Knox Manage tenant is linked to a Google Workspace tenant, there is a new test action available on the Knox Manage console. Go to Setting > Android > Android Enterprise, then click Test Connection to verify that both servers are successfully communicating. Improvement to auto-update setting for Managed Google Play apps Previously, when you assigned a Managed Google Play (MGP) app and set its Auto Update Mode to Default Update, the app would attempt to update when the device was idle or charging up to 24 hours after an update was released. As of 22.11, the Default Update option during assignment no longer uses this generic 24-hour period. Instead, it properly respects your tenant's global Auto Update Apps setting defined in your base Android Enterprise configuration. Kiosk app installation status for Android kiosks The list of devices on the Kiosk Details page now contains a column that indicates whether the latest version of the kiosk app package is installed. Improvement to Knox Browser homepage policies The sub-policies that define the default URL for the Knox Browser - Homepage URL for regular Android devices and Default URL for Android kiosks - now provide the standard Lookup button to add lookup items to the policy's value. Miscellaneous changes to Android management Lastly for Android management, Knox Manage 22.11 comes with the following miscellaneous changes: When defining the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC) settings in an APN configuration, you can now click Lookup to browse and select available lookup items. You can now employ the Samsung Knox Custom Animation policy group if you have the Knox Manage with Knox Platform for Enterprise license. On the Device Details page, the list of apps on the Application > Installed Application tab contains a Compromised column. You can now click !filter and filter for all compromised apps. The Show ProgressBar when Installing Apps policy for Android Legacy profiles is deprecated. The Enable EAS, Disable EAS, and Authenticate SD Card device commands are no longer available for fully managed devices. Support for iOS 16 Knox Manage now supports enrolling and managing devices running iOS 16. User enrollment for Apple devices The 22.11 release adds support for enrolling BYOD (personally-owned) iPhones and iPads, an activity called _user enrollment_ in the Apple ecosystem. The user account registered to the device must be tied to a Managed Apple ID in your Apple Business Manager organization. Unlike company-owned devices, BYODs can't be supervised. For this initial release of the user enrollment, Knox Manage supports iOS 13 - 15 and iPadOS 13 - 15. Before you can enroll a BYOD iPhone or iPad, you must prepare it and the target user account: 1. Enable user enrollment in the general settings of your Knox Manage tenant. 2. Attach the Managed Apple ID to the user's account in Knox Manage. See Apple User Enrollment quickstart for further details about how this feature is integrated with Knox Manage, and how to configure it and start enrolling devices. iOS policy additions Knox Manage 22.11 adds support for the following iOS policies. This batch of policies concerns keyboard features. Category Policy System Auto correction for keyboard Spell-check for keyboard Definition lookup for keyboard QuickPath keyboard Dictation Miscellaneous changes to Apple device management All instances of the term _Device Enrollment Program_ on the console are replaced with _Automated Device Enrollment_ to match the latest developments in the Apple ecosystem. Content management for Windows devices This release extends the mobile content management (MCM) features and capabilities to Windows devices. The typical behavior of Knox Manage and its agent concerning moving and deleting content applies to this platform. Content is stored in the user account's downloads directory. By default, the full destination path is: `%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\Samsung Knox Manage\\Content` You can customize the destination to be anywhere inside one of the default account media directories in Windows: Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos After content is deployed to the device, the device user can view and open it on the Content tab of the Knox Manage agent. Changes to Microsoft Store app identifiers In previous releases, when adding a public app on Microsoft Store to your tenant, you were required to register the app's package family name (PFN) as its identifier. Since not all apps on Microsoft Store have PFNs and Microsoft is in the process of retiring PFNs, the identifier is no longer mandatory in Knox Manage, and is now an optional method for locating apps on Microsoft Store. Starting with 22.11, Knox Manage automatically determines the app identifier from its Microsoft Store URL, with no additional input required from you. EMMs can't verify the installation of apps without PFNs, so the Knox Manage console reports an app without one as having an undefined ( - ) installation status. Support for Windows kiosks Knox Manage 22.11 brings kiosk mode to Windows devices. Kiosks are split between two types - single-app and multi-app. Single-app kiosks continuously run one app in full screen, while multi-app kiosks offer a selection of apps that the device user can choose from. Here's a detailed feature breakdown between the two: Single-app Windows kiosk Multi-app Windows kiosk Supported platforms Windows 10/11 Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education Non-admin account Supported app types Microsoft Edge 1 or Kiosk Browse Microsoft Store (UWP) apps Kiosk Browse Microsoft Store (UWP) apps Win32 apps User entry point Session welcome screen App grid User interface Single web browser or app Desktop with taskba Login Automatic Automatic Access to Downloads directory No Yes 1 Requires Windows 10 version 1809 or higher. For details and descriptions of Windows kiosks and how to configure them, see Manage Windows kiosks and Set up a Windows kiosk. Windows policy additions Knox Manage 22.11 adds support for the following Windows policies. This batch of policies primarily concerns apps and sharing data between them. Category Policy Application Developer Unlock DVR and Game Broadcasting Restrict App Data to System Volume All Trusted Apps App Store Auto Update Sharing App Data between Users Chrome OS policy additions Knox Manage 22.11 adds support for 66 new Chrome OS policies, plus 163 policies related to managed guest sessions. The majority of the new managed guest session policies are equivalent to existing base policies for the operating system, but are specific to that user mode. Samsung DeX with Knox Remote Support On devices running Android 10 or higher, the device user can now receive remote support when their Android device is connected to a Windows device through Samsung DeX. For instructions on how to use these features in tandem, see Use Samsung DeX during a remote session in the Knox Remote Support docs. Time zone sync in Knox Remote Support Viewer Previously, the time zone in the Knox Remote Support Viewer defaulted to UTC+00:00 the first time you accessed it. The viewer now performs an initial time zone sync with the local time of your PC. After the sync, you can change the time zone by clicking your account name and selecting Time Zone. Improvement to Knox Service Plugin integration In a previous release of Knox cloud services, use of the Google EMM API was deprecated in favor of more modern technologies, simplifying how the Knox Service Plugin interacts with EMMs. However, Knox Manage still required you to manually approve the plugin before you could apply its policies to devices. This release remedies that limitation by removing the manual approval of Knox Service Plugin. If you configure one of its policies in a profile, the Knox Manage console now automatically approves the plugin on your behalf. MSP creation of read-only admins MSPs in the Knox MSP Program can now create read-only sub-admins for Knox Manage tenants on the Knox MSP Portal. These sub-admins are stored and administered by the admin management system of the Knox MSP Program, not that of Knox Manage. Such a sub-admin can sign in to the tenant's Knox Manage console without any additional registration. Higher-level admins that belong to the Knox Manage tenant, like super admins, can view these sub admins' roles, but not manage them. Refer to Manage roles in the Knox MSP Program docs for more details. Enhancements to unenrollment actions On the Group page, you can now apply the Unenroll actions in bulk to all devices that belong to a group. Since accidental use or misuse of these actions can have severe consequences on a large number of devices at once, the console asks you to confirm twice before submitting them. Bulk user tagging The bulk user registration template for adding new users contains new elements that let you add user tags: The User sheet now has a Tags column that attaches tags to new users. A new UserTag sheet allows you to attach tags to an existing user. If you enter tags for the same user in both sheets, the UserTag sheet takes precedence. Enhanced device search on Group Details page Previously, the Device tab on the details page of a group offered only a simple search to narrow down devices, and search was limited to one device parameter - name, IMEI, user name, status, and so on - at a time. With 22.11, the search on the Device tab has been greatly expanded to allow you to combine device parameters, similar to other advanced search interfaces in the console. Enhancement to bulk app assignment When assigning apps in bulk on the Application page, you can now configure the assignment settings to the apps based on platform and source through the Common Settings dialog. For example, if you assign three Managed Google Play (MGP) apps at once, you can specify their Installation Type and Auto Update Mode settings at once. As with previous releases, you can still configure the assignment settings of a particular app by clicking See Other Apps \u25bc and adjusting its options. Per-app assignment settings override common settings. Increase to bulk app assignment limit When assigning apps in bulk on the Application page, the maximum number of apps that can be assigned in bulk is increased from 20 to 100. This limit applies to almost all apps, including those from disparate platforms and sources. For example, you can assign public MGP and Microsoft Store apps to appropriate groups at the same time. The exceptions to this limit are MGP private web apps and Apple Volume Purchase Program apps, which can't be mixed with other sources. If you select an app from either of these sources and try and mix them with others, the Assign button on the page is disabled. Knox Service Plugin audit log The Knox Manage team is committed to continuing support for Samsung's partners in the Knox Validated Program. One of the targeted improvements for 2023 is a consolidated view for all Knox Service Plugin messages automatically delivered to the servers by the plugin. You can access this view by going to History > Audit Log, and clicking KSP Feedback. From the dialog, you can click an entry's number in the Devices column and view which devices produced the message. Custom recipients for automated emails The automated email digests for both console alerts and notifications now accept custom recipients that aren't attached to accounts belonging to your tenant. To add a custom recipient to either type of digest, click Add next to Email Address, then use the Add Email Address dialog. Notification emails for keepalive When using a keepalive configuration, you can now choose to send a one-time email digest when some of your fleet's devices will expire soon. You can schedule the email to be sent on any day leading up to the keepalive duration, minus one. For example, if the keepalive duration is set to 7 days, then the earliest the email could be sent is 6 days before expiration. Updates to SCC software dependencies During the development of 22.11, the Knox Manage team revisited the software test coverage for SCC server and client vulnerabilities. The following software and development kits are now covered in the internal compliance tests. New covered items are formatted in bold. Software Test versions SCC client 2.1.0.2 2.2.0 2.3.0 2.3.1 2.5.2.1 Oracle OpenJDK 1.8.0_181 1.8.0_251 1.8.0_291 1.8.0_311 1.8.0_341 Azul Zulu Prime 1.8.0_181 1.8.0_252 1.8.0_292 1.8.0_312 1.8.0_345 During testing, the following SCC dependencies were identified as needing updates in order to resolve potential vulnerabilities: Dependency , Previous version , Current version - , - , - Apache Commons BeanUtils , 1.9.3 , 1.9.4 Apache HttpClient , 4.5.3 , 4.5.13 Bouncy Castle , 1.48 , 1.68 Hibernate ORM , 4.3.11.Final , 5.4.27.Final certserve , 0.3.18 , 0.4.0 MySQL Connector/J , 5.1.17 ,, Spring framework , 4.3.21.RELEASE , 5.3.23 Netty Project , 4.1.24.Final , 4.1.67.Final PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (pgjdbc) , 42.2.5 , 42.3.3 c3p0:JDBC DataSources/Resource Pools , 0.9.2.1 , 0.9.5.5 dom4j: flexible XML framework for Java , 2.0.0 , 2.1.3 jackson-databind , 2.8.11.3 , 2.9.10.8 log4j , 2.7.2 (client 2.17.1) , 2.17.1 h2 database ,, , 2.1.214 API updates Knox Manage API 22.11 has the following changes: Operation Change deleteDeviceByDeviceId (Delete Device By Device ID) New operation that deletes the device that has the provided unique ID assigned by Knox Manage. deleteDeviceByImei (Delete Device By Device IMEI) New operation that deletes the device that bears the provided IMEI. deleteDeviceBySerialNumber (Delete Device By SerialNumber) New operation that deletes the device that bears the provided serial number. createUse (Add Device to User) A new requestEnrollment bool parameter specifies whether to send an enrollment email to the user's address or to enroll them silently. Defaults to false. selectDeviceList (Get Device List) Three new values in the response provide additional information: lastConnectionDate is a string in YYYY-MM-DD format that returns the day when the device was last seen by the Knox servers. isDeviceLock is a bool that returns whether the device currently locked. email is a string that returns the email address of the assigned user. sendDeviceControlForLockDevice (Lock Device) A new lockMessage string parameter specifies the text of the notice that appears on the device when it's locked. This value corresponds to the Message field of the Lock Device command on the console. deleteSMSQueue (Delete SMS) Deprecated because of switch to new SMS service. selectSMSQueueList (Get SMS) Deprecated because of switch to new SMS service. updateSMSQueue (Update SMS) Deprecated because of switch to new SMS service. Notice regarding upcoming changes to report queries For reports, the Ownership code and Ownership fields are deprecated, and return no data. Both fields are slated for removal with the 23.03 release. If you generate a report containing only one of these fields, it will be blank. Use the Management Type field as a replacement. Back to release notes",

Update to supported Android versions In accordance with our updated Android support plan, the minimum supported version for Android devices registered in Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA, Knox Configure, and Knox Deployment app have each rolled forward. To review the minimum version on a product-by-product basis, see Policy update on Knox supported versions. Simplified registration for and access to Knox cloud services The registration and access flows for Knox cloud services are streamlined. The My Knox dashboard is retired, and you can now sign in to the Knox Admin Portal directly and manage your Knox services, including Knox Manage. After you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you can operate Knox Manage right away. If you'd like to display or register for additional Knox services, click your account icon > Settings > Show/hide services. Android Legacy deprecation With 23.03, Knox Manage no longer officially supports the Android Legacy platform. The Knox Manage team strongly recommends that you migrate to the latest Android Enterprise platform. For detailed information about migrating your device fleet, see the Android Legacy to Android Enterprise migration guide. New Knox Manage license type The Knox Manage license is now split into two types - legacy licenses with the KLM09 prefix, and newer licenses with the KLM12 prefix. Benefits of the KLM12 license include: Frictionless access to all Knox Platform for Enterprise features, including Premium features, without the need for additional Knox Manage with Knox Platform for Enterprise licenses. The ability to seamlessly downgrade from a Knox Suite license to a Knox Manage license, without the need to re-enroll devices and reassign them the new license. The legacy Knox Manage license will be deprecated in a later release. If you are an existing customer, the Knox Manage team recommends that you switch from the legacy license to the new license to enjoy its benefits. Contact your local reseller to obtain the newer license. The legacy license will only remain available to customers who have already purchased it. For more information, see Licenses Overview and Change a license. Updates to trial license You can now re-assign trial Knox Manage and Knox Suite licenses to your tenant when your trial license expires. Previously, a trial license could only be assigned to your tenant once. Support for fully managed mode with AMAPI Previously, the Android Management API (AMAPI) platform with Knox Manage only supported Android devices in work profile mode. With 23.03, Knox Manage now supports fully managed mode for the AMAPI platform. You can enroll devices in this mode through _user-based_ enrollment (requires a user account) or _userless_ enrollment (requires an enrollment token issued by the IT admin). User-based enrollment supports activation through a QR code, while userless enrollment supports activation through tokens. Both also support other enrollment technologies, those being Knox Mobile Enrollment and Zero-touch To get started enrolling fully managed devices, see Android Management API device enrollment quickstart. Support for kiosks with AMAPI Knox Manage now supports kiosks on the AMAPI platform. Like with the Android Enterprise platform, both Single-app Kiosk and Multi-app Kiosk modes are available. AMAPI kiosks differ in that apps can only be managed through MGP, and they have limited options for customizing the interface. Only a handful of UI elements, such as the status and navigation bars, can be disabled. The Kiosk Wizard isn't available for this platform, therefore Home screen elements, such as app shortcuts, folders, widgets, the favorite apps, and the wallpaper, can't be adjusted. For step-by-step information about creating kiosks for AMAPI profiles, see Set up an Android Management API kiosk. Delegated scope additions for Android and AMAPI New delegation scopes are available for Android Enterprise and AMAPI. The new scopes apply to both fully managed and work profile modes, and are supported across various versions of Android higher than 9. For complete technical details about these delegated scopes, see Android Enterprise policies and Android Management API policies. Platform Delegation Scope Android Enterprise Management of uninstalled packages Installing existing package Selection of key chain certificates Network logging Security logging AMAPI Management of uninstalled packages Installing existing package Selection of key chain certificates Enhancements to location policy for Android The Location Setting policy is in the process of being deprecated, and the GPS policy is receiving additional values that are commensurate with the Location Setting policy's prior behavior. As of 23.03, Location Settings is disabled, and will be removed in a future release. For this release, the GPS policy takes precedence over any value of the Location Settings policy. When you save your policy changes to a profile, if the Location Settings policy is set to Disallow and the GPS policy is unset, a pop-up will guide you into giving the GPS policy a value. Update link to Google Enterprise account Previously, the Knox Manage console provided you the option of delinking the EMM connection between your Knox Manage tenant and your Google Enterprise account on the Setting > Android > Android Enterprise page through an action named Delete EMM. As of 23.03, that action is renamed to Replace EMM. If for whatever reason you need to link your tenant to a different Google Enterprise account - such as the case of the account becoming unrecoverable - you can seamlessly transition all your devices and MGP app assignments to the new linked account. For more information, see Configure the Android Enterprise environment and Update EMM provider information. Lock expiry notification for Android You can now alert the user when their device lock will expire soon. Two new When to send notification before expiration policies - one for fully managed mode, the other for work profile mode - let you push a notification 1, 3, 5, or 7 days before the lock's expiry date. The notification persists until the device user changes the lock. Improvements to custom wallpaper policies for Android Previously, the Custom Wallpaper policy set the same wallpaper for both the Home and lock screens, and could only function if the Wallpaper Change policy was set to Allow. With Knox Manage 23.03, the Custom Wallpaper policy no longer depends on the latter policy, and now allows you to set a separate wallpaper for each screen. In order to apply separate wallpapers, the device must run Knox Manage agent 23.03 or higher. Easy identification of app updates The 23.03 release brings a quality of life change to the Application page. When an app has an available update, it's tagged with Need Update in the Version column, making it much easier to identify multiple out-of-date apps at once and facilitating updating them in bulk from one view. This UI enhancement applies to apps sourced from Google Play, Managed Google Play, and Apple App Store. Content management for iOS and iPadOS Knox Manage 23.03 introduces much-requested support for mobile content management on the two Apple platforms. You can now add, push, and sync files to managed iPhones and iPads. The device user can view and manually sync the content in the new Content screen of the Knox Manage agent. If the agent doesn't support a file's type, the device user can open it in an external app. For more information about the available content management features, see Add content. Home Screen customization for iOS and iPadOS With the new Home Screen Layout policy, you can now create one or more custom layouts for the Home Screen of iPhones and iPads. You can specify the app shortcuts, web clips, and folders in the Page area, and the four favorite apps in the Dock area. Update the eSIM Cellular Plan device command for iOS and iPadOS A new command, Update the eSIM Cellular Plan, queries the URL for active eSIM profiles on iPhones and iPads. The command is supported on iOS 14 and higher, iPadOS 13 and higher, and Shared iPads. For more information, see Update the eSIM Cellular Plan in the Apple Developer documentation. Managed configurations for iOS and iPadOS apps With Knox Manage 23.03, when assigning internal iOS and iPadOS apps, you can now define a managed configuration, provided the app supports them. For the details of defining a managed configuration, see Assign internal Android and iOS apps. The List of lookup items covers all the values you can pass to an app. Improvement to notifications for iOS, iPadOS, Windows agents Previously, when you pushed a notification through the Knox Manage agent on certain platforms, only the title of the notification would display on the lock screen (iOS, iPadOS) or the action center (Windows). To view the message body of the notification, the device user had to unlock the device (iOS, iPadOS) or select the notification (Windows). As of 23.03, this issue is resolved on all three platforms, and the notification displays its complete text in all circumstances. Improvement to forced unenrollment for Windows Previously, if you force-unenrolled a Windows device while it was connected to a network, the device would unenroll at the agent level, but not on the Knox Manage server. This release fixes that issue. Chrome OS policy additions Knox Manage 23.03 adds support for 46 new Chrome OS policies. The salient policies are: Policy group New policy Users &amp; Browsers Managed account as secondary account Compromised password alerts Print PDF as image Device Forced re-enrollment Auto-update settings Reboot on sign-out Managed guest sessions Clipboard Portuguese localization for Chrome OS policies When viewing Chrome OS policies on the Knox Manage console, the policy names are now available in Portuguese. License conversion information When changing licenses, the options in the Select Change License Type dialog are more descriptive and comprehensive, and properly explain which conversions are upgrades, replacements, or downgrades. Admins now see the conversions that they have permission to perform. The dialog also accounts for the new KLM12 license. The aim of these changes is to help you make a more informed decision when modifying your licenses. Unenroll devices from Knox Mobile Enrollment Previously, when you unenrolled a device originally registered through Knox Mobile Enrollment, it would be removed from your Knox Manage tenant, but not your Knox Mobile Enrollment tenant. With 23.03, when you begin unenrolling a device added by Knox Mobile Enrollment, you now have the option to remove it from that service as well as Knox Manage. This functionality is only available if you sign in to your admin account with a Samsung Account or a supported third-party SSO identity provider. Restrict sub-admin access to secure codes You can now control a sub-admin's ability to view to your tenant's secure codes - Unlock Code, Unenrollment Code, and Exit Kiosk Code - when they inspect a device on the Device Details page. To restrict access, when creating their account, select Security Code in the Device. Status bar color picker in Kiosk Wizard In the Kiosk Wizard, you can now customize the color of the Status bar and text. You can select a hexadecimal background color with a color picker, and set the text color to either black or white. For more information, see Kiosk Wizard menu items. Smart View setting in Kiosk Wizard When configuring a kiosk's Device Settings in the Kiosk Wizard, you can now toggle Samsung Smart View. For more information, see Configure kiosk device settings. Dual-SIM ICCIDs on Device Details page The ICCID field in the details of a device now accurately reflects the current state of both SIM slots on a dual-SIM device by displaying both detected SIM ICCIDs. Improvement to client error KMA_F4021 To ease troubleshooting, the error for a device activation failure, KMA_F4021, now provides the last four digits of the license number at the end of its message in the Knox Manage agent. The message now reads: [ERROR] [KMA_F4021] License Activation Failed The license activation operation has failed due to the expired license. Please contact your administrator. [701:ERROR_LICENSE_EXPIRED:XVYX] Managed app information in device CSV reports When exporting device information to a CSV file on the Device page, you now have the option to export additional information about the managed apps for those devices - which apps are assigned, which are installed, and which are assigned but not installed. For more information, see View the device list. Location history reports as XLSX files Previously, you could only export device location history as a GPX file. You now have the additional option of exporting the report as an XLSX. The spreadsheet includes Date, Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude columns. For more information, see Check the locations of devices. Improvement to KSP license key field Previously, the Knox Service Plugin policy group on the Set Policy page would display an empty Knox Service Plugin (KSP) license key field if you hadn't yet activated the plugin and entered a license key. As of 23.03, if KSP isn't activated and no license key is provided, the license key field is hidden. Update to name format of ADE devices Previously, devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) were named using a format that included the term AppleDEP, which reflected the program's original name. Both device name formats now use the correct program name: AppleADE_iOS\\__#SequenceNumber_ _UserID_\\_AppleADE_iOS\\__#SequenceNumber_ When you enroll a device after the 23.03 release, Knox Manage names it with the updated format. Devices enrolled prior to 23.03 retain their original names. For information on how to select a name format, see Automated Device Enrollment quickstart. Improvement to software downloads in console When downloading the SCC client or the Knox Remote Support app from the Download dialog on the Knox Manage console, the client version now displays next to the software's name. Updates to lookup fields and device information On the Knox Manage console, the Ownership and Ownership Code fields are no longer available as report queries in the Device Basic Information category, and as of 23.03 these fields are removed from any reports and dashboards that contain them. For more information, see Default reports and report queries. Additionally, two new look items have been added - Device Tags and Device Alias. Console terminology updates The following terms have been updated on the Knox Manage console. Page or element Previous term New term Application menu Managed Google Play Private Web Managed Google Play Web Knox Remote Support dialog Allowed by Use Ask users to start Force Run Automatically start (Force run) Kiosk app settings Single App Single App Mode Multi App Multi App Mode Kiosk Browse Web Mode API changes Knox Manage API 23.03 has the following changes: Operation , Change - , - sendDeviceControlForRebootDevice (Reboot a device) , New operation that remotely reboots a device. Notice regarding upcoming changes to Network Time Protocol Settings policy Currently, the Network Time Protocol Settings policy has three values, N/A, Allow, Disallow. The behavior of N/A and Disallow is the same. With Knox Manage 23.06, the Disallow option will be removed. If by that time you have any profiles that set the policy to Disallow, its value will automatically switch to N/A. Notice regarding changes to Samsung Knox (AE) Bluetooth policies With Knox Manage 23.03, the Bluetooth UUID Allowlist Setting and Bluetooth UUID Blocklist Setting policies are supported only for Android 13 and lower. Notice regarding Samsung Cloud Connector Client support Samsung Cloud Connector (SCC) client v2.5.2_20221007 was released with Knox Manage 22.11. To minimize undefined behavior and downtime, you must update your SCC Client to the latest version by May, 2023. Notice regarding upcoming directory integration deprecation Support for directory integration will begin sunsetting with Knox Manage 23.06, and cease in 2024. Sync services are a suitable replacement for all directory functionality. For information about switching to a sync service, see View the directory connector status. For more general information, consult how to Manage sync services. Back to release notes",

Upon initial device activation, Android Enterprise and Android Management API (AMAPI) devices are verified by the Play Integrity API by default, even when the policy is not set. You can define when to run periodic verifications on Android Enterprise devices. If a verification fails, you can choose to receive alerts, or automatically lock or unenroll and factory reset the device. For AMAPI devices, verification is performed only once during the initial activation. You can specify automatic unenrollment and factory reset of devices that fail verification. The SafetyNet Attestation API is being deprecated in June 2024. The Play Integrity API offers improved detection of device-side accounts as well as Google Play app and user accounts. There is no change in policy options between the two APIs. The Knox Manage team strongly recommends that you upgrade to the latest Knox Manage agent, which supports both the APIs for now, and migrate to the new Play Integrity API. For information about how to migrate, see Migrate from SafetyNet Attestation API in the Android Developer documentation. Ability to remove the work area on Android Enterprise and AMAPI devices Previously, for Android Enterprise devices in the Work Profile on Company-owned mode, you had to factory reset the device to successfully unenroll it from Knox Manage. With Knox Manage 23.06, you can now remove only the work area from a Work Profile on Company-owned Android Enterprise device or an AMAPI device, without the need to factory reset it. Device users can continue using the device as is. The Remove Work Profile only option removes any installed Knox Manage agents from the work and personal areas of a company-owned device. This action removes all policies from the work and personal areas, such that the device doesn't retain any management policies whatsoever. You can predefine a notification message template for this change and push notifications to the device users. For more information, see Unenroll devices and Android Enterprise device commands. Ability to lock the work area on Android devices Previously, you could lock the whole device on expiry of the keepalive interval. With Knox Manage 23.06, you can now lock just the work area on an Android device when its keepalive interval expires. The device user must manually enter a passcode to unlock it. To use this feature, the device users need to first go to Device settings > Workspace and disable the Use one lock option on the device. For more information, see Configure the keepalive settings. Auto-installation of multiple certificates on Android devices Previously, it was possible to automatically install a single certificate only on an Android device. With Knox Manage 23.06, multiple certificates can be automatically installed on the device, if no user certificate passwords are required for installation. Additionally, a device lock password must be set on the device before installing certificates. For more information about certificates in Knox Manage, see Android Enterprise policies. Bulk uninstallation of Chrome PWA apps With Knox Manage 23.06, you can use the Uninstall App device command to uninstall, in bulk, the Chrome progressive web apps (PWA) from enrolled Android devices. Ability to view password compliance details for a work profile With Knox Manage 23.06, you can now view the password compliance status of an Android device's work profile under the Security tab on the Device Details page. Previously, you could view only the device's password status on the page. For information about the Device Details page, see View details of a device. Support for app component blocklists You can now specify app component-level blocklists for Samsung Knox devices. The blocklists can be set at the device level or for a work profile. For more information, see Samsung Knox running Android Enterprise policies.. Managed configuration for internal Android apps With Knox Manage 23.06, you can create managed configurations for internal Android apps. Previously, you could create managed configurations for other app types. A managed configuration specifies the app settings that IT admins can control. You can also check for and review any feedback received on your internal apps. To do so, go to Device Details > Application > Installed Application > View Feedback. For more information, see Add internal Android and iOS applications and Assign internal Android, iOS, and Windows apps. Reset user password improvements When you add users in Knox Manage, you can specify if they must reset their passwords when they first sign in to a device. For Android devices, Reset after Sign-in now applies to: The work profile on personally- and company-owned devices, Secondary users on shared devices, Provisioned accounts on non-shared devices This feature is not available for: Staging users on shared and non-shared Android devices, Users synced from third-party identity provider integrations, Devices activated by Knox Mobile Enrollment For more information, see Register a single user account. Support for device commands in Direct Boot mode Previously, device users needed to manually update any queued-up device commands after device reboot. For Android Enterprise devices released since 2021 and running Android 11 and higher, Knox Manage 23.06 supports two device commands - Update License and Convert License - in the Direct Boot mode. The commands are automatically applied to the device after reboot, but before it is unlocked. Enrollment process improvements Previously, device users needed to tap a few enrollment screens after entering their credentials to complete the enrollment. With Knox Manage 23.06, enrolling Android devices is easier than ever, and completed with fewer taps. Device users need only to sign in to enroll the device. No other manual action is required and the users are taken directly to the home screen afterwards. Android Management API improvements With Knox Manage 23.06, AMAPI devices now support the following: A new system policy - Certificate Setting - to allow or restrict users from setting certificates on their devices. An unlimited expiration period for tokens generated for device enrollment. Previously, the maximum period was 90 days. Two new device commands: Reboot device, for fully managed devices and , Delete app data, for fully managed devices and devices with work profiles. For more information, see Android Enterprise policies and Android Enterprise device commands. Windows OS policy additions Knox Manage 23.06 enhances support for Windows OS devices with new policies: You can define proxy configurations with three different connection types - Proxy Server, Setup Script, Auto Detect. You can set up Windows Hello for secure access to Windows devices, with authentication based on biometrics, PIN, or the Trusted Platform Module technology. You can also set other Custom policies that are not available by default through the Windows configuration service provider. For more information, see Windows policies. Support for MSI command line options for Windows devices With Knox Manage 23.06, you can now use Microsoft Standard Installer (MSI) command line options to manually set how to run and configure internal apps after they're installed. For more information, see Add internal Windows apps. iOS device command improvements Previously, disconnected iOS devices supported a single device command, Unenroll Device. With Knox Manage 23.06, disconnected iOS devices support the same device commands as connected devices. The commands are executed when the device connects to the Knox Manage server. For a list of all iOS device commands, see iOS device commands. Shared iPad policy additions With Knox Manage 23.06, Shared iPads running iOS/iPadOS 16 and higher support two new policies: Managed Apple ID Default Domains, to specify up to three default domains for your enterprise's managed Apple account. Online Authentication Grace Period (Days), to specify the number of days after which network authentication is required on the device. For more information, see Automated Device Enrollment quickstart. iOS and iPadOS network configuration policy improvements For devices running iOS 14/iPadOS 14 and higher, you can now configure Per-App VPN and specify the apps allowed to connect to the internet through the VPN. The configuration applies to all VPN, except L2TP and PPTP. With Knox Manage 23.06, you can configure Wi-Fi using the new QoS Marking Policy to manage network traffic. You can also specify additional Wi-Fi security types, and enable the Captive Bypass feature for secure access to public W-Fi. For more information, see iOS policies. iOS device information improvements With Knox Manage 23.06, you can now view additional details for iOS devices. For dual SIM devices or devices that support eSIMs, the Device Details page displays two IMEI numbers.

Knox Remote Support for AMAPI devices Previously, you could use Knox Remote Support only for Android Enterprise devices. You can now remotely support AMAPI devices using Knox Remote Support. To start a session, send an SMS to the AMAPI device. The SMS has instructions to install the Knox Remote Support agent and an access code to initiate the session. Mobile Admin access improvements With Knox Manage 23.06, the mobile sign-in screen to access the Knox Manage Mobile Admin Dashboard is updated. Device users now see the Go to Mobile Admin option after they select Sign In with Knox Manage Account on their mobile browser. For more information, see Get started on using Mobile Admin. Improvements to the Kiosk wizard You can now use the Text widget to easily identify the user name and user ID of kiosks. The Text widget, available for multi-app kiosks, supports the use of dynamic lookup items, User Name and User ID, which are automatically replaced by real-time values at runtime. You can use these lookups to display a kiosk's information on its screen. For more information, see Utilities in the Kiosk Wizard. Support for license key to use DualDAR and UCM With Knox Manage 23.06, you can enter Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) Premium or Knox Suite license keys in the Knox Manage console to enable DualDAR encryption and Universal Credential Manager (UCM) for Samsung Knox devices. To be able to enter the license key, you must first select the Enable Dual DAR controls and Enable UCM policy controls for the profile.

Improvements to integrations with other Knox products Knox Manage 23.06 offers the following enhancements for integrations with other Knox products: To avoid installation failure, the Knox Asset Intelligence app is now added to the list of approved app installers for the Knox Manage agent. Knox Remote Support is now available to Managed Service Provider (MSP) customers from the MSP portal. Support for CA direct connection Previously, a certificate authority (CA) could be provided only using Cloud Connector. With Knox Manage 23.06, you can now also use the Direct Connection option that supports the CA of an authorized public network. For more information, see Certificate authority (CA). Alert mailing improvements Knox Manage 23.06 supports additional alert events to trigger email notifications to IT admins. You can search for audit events by name and select any audit event to create an alert for your admins. In addition, the Alert page now displays the Level column instead of the Alert Type column. For more information, see Configure alerts. Samsung Knox policy improvements Know Manage 23.06 supports new values - N/A and Apply - for the Network Time Protocol Settings system policy.

            "content": "Knox Manage 23.09 release notes. Samsung Cloud Connector Client v2.6.2 Samsung Cloud Connector Client v2.6.2 is released alongside Knox Manage 23.09. The new version patches security vulnerabilities with some of its open source dependencies. The Knox Manage team strongly recommends that you download and install the latest version of the connector. For more information, see Install the SCC client. Enhanced OS compatibility of Samsung Cloud Connector With 23.09, the Samsung Cloud Connector client is now also compatible with the Windows Server 2022 (64-bit) operating system. For more information, see Prerequisites for installing SCC. Enhancements for shared Samsung devices Previously, for shared Android Enterprise device from all manufacturers, when a secondary user first signed in, they were prompted to manually run the Knox Manage agent to complete activation. Starting with 23.09, shared Samsung devices no longer require this extra activation step, while non-Samsung devices still do. Additionally for all shared devices, apps common to staging users and secondary users are downloaded and installed on the device when it's enrolled with the staging user account. These apps are ready-to-use when a secondary user signs in to the shared device. Like in previous versions, apps only assigned to a secondary user's profile, are automatically downloaded and installed when the user signs in. This reduces the time taken to prepare the device for secondary user when they sign in. Ability to set timeout limits for Android Enterprise devices Previously, you could set a single maximum time limit for a device's screen timeout with the Maximum Screen Timeout policy. With Knox Manage 23.09, you can now set two time limits - one for the whole device and the other for the work profile. The value you define is the maximum time that devices users can specify as their screen timeout limits. The manner in which the timeout settings apply depends on the Use one lock device setting.

With 23.09, for devices running Android 13 and higher, the Knox Manage agent is automatically disabled and hidden on the personal profile when a device is activated. The device user can choose to uninstall the agent, as before. Wi-Fi policy additions for Android Enterprise With Knox Manage 23.09, new Wi-Fi policies - Domain and Alternate Subject - are now available for the 802.1xEAP protocol for devices running Android 13 and higher. The policies are supported for the Android Enterprise and Android Management API platforms and for all staging devices. At least one of these two policies and the CA Certificate policy must now be specified when using 802.1xEAP. Updates to Automatic Date and Time policy for Android Enterprise Previously for devices running Android 12 and higher and One UI 4.1 and higher, when the Automatic Date and Time policy was set to Enforce time zone, the Automatic Date and Time setting on the device was disabled if Automatic time zone was turned on. With Knox Manage 23.09, the Automatic Date and Time setting is no longer disabled when both policies are set. Terminology updates for the Location policy for Android Enterprise The terms used for the Location policy and its sub-policies are updated as follows: Type , Previous name , New name , Notes - , - , - , - Policy , High Accuracy Mode , Location Accuracy Value , Do not use , (none) , The old Do not use value is automatically mapped to the new Ask user to turn on value.

Updates for devices with expired licenses Devices with expired licenses continue to maintain the settings and policies already applied to them, but are restricted from using most Knox Manage features, such as applying settings or assigning apps, profiles, or content to such devices. Previously, IT admins were only able to unenroll such devices or update their license. Starting with 23.09, additional features are restricted on devices with expired licenses, such as location tracking, device inventory sync, event profiles, keepalive, and Play Integrity API. For more information, see Renew an expired license. Updates related to fully-managed AMAPI devices With 23.09, support for management and monitoring of new fully-managed AMAPI devices is restricted. Existing fully-managed AMAPI devices and fully-managed Android devices are unaffected. If you want to enroll a device as fully-managed, use the Android Enterprise platform instead. As before, you can continue using work-profiles on AMAPI devices. Updates for Android kiosks With Knox Manage 23.09, the following changes apply to kiosks: You can now update and install single-app and multi-app kiosk app packages using the `sendDeviceControlForInstallApp` operation.

            "content": "How to configure a Wi-Fi network with EAP-PEAP authentication using an external certificate in Knox Manage. This knowledge base article teaches you how to configure Wi-Fi networks with EAP-PEAP authentication, using corporate certificates with Knox Manage. It also provides an overview on why you might want to use a secure network to protect your company data. Why should I secure my enterprise Wi-Fi network? If you leave your wireless network unsecure, your corporate data is vulnerable to external attacks and could be accessed by other devices. To protect your network, consider configuring one of the following security methods: Authentication: Identify and approve a request from a device or software (also knowns as a supplicant) to access a network. Once the request is approved, the device can access the network. Cryptography: Data sent over the network is encrypted, and only devices equipped with pre-shared keys can encrypt or decrypt transmitted data. Certificate: Encryption generates a public and private key. The public key, found in the digital certificate, encrypts data that is sent to the certificate owner. The private key is held only by the certificate owner, and decrypts the information encrypted by the public key. 802.1X authentication is the security protocol most commonly used by large companies. With 802.1X, an authentication method is used between the client and a server connected to the access point, after which a secure connection is established between the two. This process can use identity credentials, with per-user and/or per-session keys to increase security. This guide shows you how to set up Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) with certificates on KM, which enhances 802.1X authentication. How does Knox Manage secure my enterprise Wi-Fi network? KM uses external certificates to handle network services like Wi-Fi, VPN, and APNs. It supports three types of EAPs: 1. EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security): Relies on client-side and server-side certificates for authentication. The certificates must be managed on both sides, which can be time-consuming for a large WLAN installation. 2. EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security): Mutually authenticates the client and network through an encrypted channel. This security method requires only server-side certificates. 3. PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol): Transports securely authenticated data, including legacy password-based protocols. PEAP uses only server-side certificates to authenticate Wi-Fi LAN clients. The chart below compares the different 802.1X EAP types and their features: Feature TLS TTLS PEAP Serve-side certificate Required Required Required Device-side certificate Required Not required Not required Deployment difficulty Very difficult (due to client certificate deployment) Difficult Difficult Wi-Fi security Very high High High How do I configure and deploy a Wi-Fi network with EAP-PEAP authentication using a Knox Manage certificate? Before you configure Wi-Fi EAP authentication for your network, you need to register both a user certificate and root certificate on the KM server. The user certificate must be in P12 or PFX format, and the root certificate must be in CER, DER, PFX, or P12 format. ##For the user certificate: 1. In your KM console, go to Advanced > Certificate > External Certificate. 2. Click Add. 3. Enter a name for your user certificate. 4. Under Purpose, select Wifi. 5. Under Type, select User. 6. Under File Name, upload a certificate file in PFX or P12 format. 7. Enter a password and description. ##For the root certificate: 1. In your KM console, go to Advanced > Certificate > External Certificate. 2. Click Add. 3. Enter a name for your user certificate. 4. Under Purpose, select Wifi. 5. Under Type, select Root. 6. Under File Name, upload a certificate file in CER, DER, PFX or P12 format. 7. Enter a password and description. You can then configure a Wi-Fi policy with EAP-PEAP authentication using your newly-added certificates. Below are the steps to configure the network in Android Legacy: 1. In your KM console, go to Profile > Wi-Fi. 2. Under Security type, select 802.1xEAP. 3. Under EAP Method, select PEAP. 4. Under User information input method, select User Information to allow users to access the network with their KM credentials. 5. Under User Certificate, select the user certificate you added. Note that all users share this certificate. 6. Under CA certificate, select the root certificate you added. 7. Click Save & Assign, then assign the profile to a group or organization. For Wi-Fi policies with the security type 802.1xEAP, the configuration process has been updated for the following: Samsung devices running Android 13 or higher, with an Android security patch version from June 2023 or later, Google devices running Android 13 or higher, with a Google Play system update version from April 2023 or later When configuring the Wi-Fi policy, the following fields are required: CA certificate, Domain or Alternate Subject If the required fields are not completed, the configuration will fail.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "How to develop an app using managed AppConfig settings and apply them in Knox Manage. This knowledge base article shows developers how to implement managed configuration settings in their apps, and guides IT admins through the steps on how to apply managed configurations in Knox Manage (KM). What is AppConfig? AppConfig is a standard approach for app configuration and management that supports developers and customers in driving business mobility. KM introduced managed configurations as an implementation of AppConfig, designed as an easy way for IT admins to configure enterprise mobile apps. As a developer, Google also provides you with native Android APIs to support managed AppConfig through KM. Why should I use AppConfig and managed configurations? If you are developing apps for the enterprise market, you may need to satisfy particular requirements set by an organization's policies. Managed Configurations, previously known as application restrictions, allow the organization's IT admin to remotely specify settings for apps. This feature is particularly useful for organization-approved apps deployed to an Android Enterprise work profile. Each app defines the managed configuration options that IT admins can set remotely through KM. If your app is running in a work profile, the admin can change your app's managed configuration. As a developer, how do I implement managed AppConfig in my app? Let's assume you are developing an app that should be configured with a server address. To do so: 1. Open your app's resource XML file, typically found inside the res/xml/ folder. Using the schema shown below, this file declares all the managed AppConfig keys that are supported by your app. KM automatically pulls the details of the keys using Google Play APIs, ```xml <restriction android:key=\"address\" android:title=\"@string/title\" android:restrictionType=\"string\" android:description=\"@string/description\" android:defaultValue=\"sample address\"/> ``` 2. In your app's manifest file, under the application tag, declare the restrictions xml file. ```xml <application android:allowBackup=\"true\" android:icon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher\" android:label=\"@string/app_name\" android:roundIcon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher_round\" android:supportsRtl=\"true\" android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme\"> <meta-data android:name=\"android.content.APP_RESTRICTIONS\" android:resource=\"@xml/app_restrictions\" /> ``` 3. Next, dynamically register your activity to listen for the ACTION_APPLICATION_RESTRICTIONS_CHANGED intent. Doing so ensures that any new or updated values pushed by KM's managed configuration are also received by the app. ```xml IntentFilter restrictionFilter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_APPLICATION_RESTRICTIONS_CHANGED); BroadcastReceiver restrictionReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() }; ``` In order for an app to fetch an EMM-provided managed AppConfig, Google requires the app to be published from a source that KM can pull from and publish to enrolled Android devices. Organizations might choose to publish the app in the Google Play Store, or they can use private channels if they have a limited audience. As a Knox Manage admin, how do I set up managed configurations for an enterprise app? The UI for Managed Configuration now uses a custom method from Google's iframe method for better flexibility and improved usability, for example using diverse Wildcards. If you have already set up a managed configuration, you can choose to either use the previous configuration or use a new method. If there is no existing configuration, the new method is used for each new configuration. To push the managed AppConfig for enterprise apps from the KM console: 1. Navigate to Group > Select the checkbox next to the desired group > Click Assign Application. 2. Select the app and click Assign. 3. Next to Target Device, select Android Enterprise. Then, under Android Enterprise Settings, next to Auto-run after Install, select Yes. Click Set Configuration. 4. If the app follows Google's guidelines and the managed AppConfig keys are set up correctly, then KM can pull and populate the keys and their corresponding key types. The KM admin can then assign corresponding values for the new configuration. Enter the server address and click Save. KM's Managed Configuration interface now uses Google's iframe method for better improved usability. If you have already set up a managed configuration, you can choose to either use the previous configuration or use a new method. If there is no existing configuration, the new method is used for each new configuration. 5. Click Assign to push the new configuration to the group's devices. 6. Click OK to assign and start the newly-configured app on the devices. If the app is running on the devices and the developer has correctly registered it to receive the managed restriction broadcast, it then receives the updated values pushed by KM.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "How to configure Android OpenVPN client with certificate authentication using Knox Manage. Using OpenVPN Connect, you can set up a VPN connection for your mobile devices to securely access your corporate network. This article walks you through the steps on how to set up the OpenVPN Connect client with certificate authentication (CA), using Knox Manage (KM) for client installation and certification provisioning. To configure Android OpenVPN with CA for KM: 1. In KM, add the OpenVPN Connect application. 2. Create a PKCS12 certificate using an OpenVPN configuration file. 3. Upload the PKCS12 certificate to KM. 4. In the OpenVPN app, import the OpenVPN configuration file and select the certificate from the Android Keystore system. 5. Connect your device to the VPN. How do I add the OpenVPN Connect application in Knox Manage? 1. In your KM console, go to Application > Add > Public. 2. In the search bar, enter \"OpenVPN\" and click Search. 3. Select \"OpenVPN Connect\" by OpenVPN. 4. On the OpenVPN Connect application page, click Approve. ![](../assets/image200-1.png) 5. In the pop-up window that appears, click Approve. 6. Click Done, then click Save. 7. Go to Application. 8. Under the OpenVPN application, click Assign. 9. Under Target device, select Android Enterprise with the Automatic install type. 10. Under Target section, select your group or organization, then click Assign. How do I create a PKCS12 Certificate using an OpenVPN configuration file? If you use OpenVPN configuration files with embedded certificates, extract the certificates in PKCS12 format. This prevents sensitive information, like private keys, from being transferred and stored in the configuration file. Instead, they will be provisioned through Knox Manage and stored safely in the device's Android Keystore system. You can use OpenSSL to combine sections of the OpenVPN configuration file into a PKCS12 certificate. To do so: 1. In a text editor, open your OpenVPN configuration file in a text editor. 2. Find the following sections in the file: ``` ... ... ... ``` 3. Copy the text in the `` section to a new text file. Ensure the content matches the following format: ``` - BEGIN CERTIFICATE - ... (certificate contents) - END CERTIFICATE - ``` 4. Save the new text file as \"ca.crt\". 5. Repeat Step 3 for the `` section, saving it as \"client.crt\". 6. Repeat Step 3 for the `` section, saving it as \"client.key\". After copying the certificate information out of the OpenVPN configuration, you should have three files named \"ca.crt\", \"client.crt\", and \"client.key\". You can now use OpenSSL to combine them: 1. On your computer, install OpenSSL. 2. In your file manager, navigate to the folder containing your \"ca.crt\", \"client.crt\", and \"client.key\" files. 3. Open Command Prompt and enter the following SSL command: ``` openssl pkcs12 -export -in client.crt -inkey client.key -certfile ca.crt -name MyClient -out client.p12 ``` When prompted, enter a strong password to secure your certificate with. You now have an OpenVPN-compatible \"client.p12\" certificate that you can upload to KM and push to your device's Android Keystore. How do I upload a PKCS12 Certificate to Knox Manage and push it to my device's Android Keystore? 1. In your KM console, go to Advanced > Certificate > External Certificate > Add. 2. Upload your \"client.p12\" certificate and enter the information as shown below: 3. Click Save. To store the client certificate in your device's Android Keystore: 1. In your KM console, go to Profile. 2. Click on your device's profile > Modify Policy. 3. Select Certificate, then enter the information as shown below: 4. Click Save and Apply. To install the client certificate on your device: 1. In the KM client on your device, navigate to Download Configuration > Install. 2. Tap OK. To sync the OpenVPN configuration file (*.ovpn) with your device: 1. In your KM console, under Content, upload the configuration file to to KM. 2. Enter the information as shown below: Ensure your OpenVPN configuration file follows this format: ``` client dev tun proto udp remote port 1194 resolv-retry infinite nobind user nobody group nogroup persist-key persist-tun remote-cert-tls server cipher AES-256-CBC auth SHA256 verb 3 ``` How do I import an OpenVPN configuration file into the OpenVPN app? 1. In the OpenVPN app on your device, go to Import Profile > File. 2. Select your configuration file and tap IMPORT > ADD. 3. Select your profile and tap Select Certificate. 4. Choose your certificate, then tap Select. After you import your OpenVPN profile and certificate, complete the configuration by enabling the profile in the app and connecting to the VPN.

Google recently deprecated two Android device management modes: Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP): was deprecated in Android 11 and replaced with a new work profile on company-owned device, Device admin (DA): was already deprecated in Android 10, and now app updates must target Android 10 Read on to learn how these deprecated modes are now supported by Knox Manage and the actions you must take to avoid service disruptions. Fully managed device with a work profile As previously mentioned through the Knox Manage release notes - August 27, 2020, Android 11 continues to protect user privacy, by limiting an enterprise's ability to view or manage personal activities on a company device. More specifically, Google has replaced fully managed device with a work profile with a new work profile on company-owned device. With Android 11: New device enrollments: Knox Manage no longer allows a fully managed device with a work profile, by Google policy. Existing device enrollments: Knox Manage provides these migration options: Work profile on company-owned device:\"Upon firmware update to Android 11, Knox Manage automatically migrates a fully managed device with a work profile to this new mode by default. A work profile on a corporate device differs from that on a personal device in that additional management policies are allowed at the device level. For details, see work profile on company-owned devices. Fully managed device:\"Knox Manage provides a Device Command called Switch to Fully Managed (Remove Work Profile) so the IT Admin doesn't have to conduct a device factory reset. This migration using the Device Command must be done _before_ the upgrade to Android 11. Separated Apps:\"Once you migrate to a fully managed device, you can then use the Knox Service Plugin to add a Separated Apps folder to contain authorized third-party business apps. For details, see Separated Apps. Android Legacy With the shift in deployment mode from Android Legacy to Android Enterprise, most of the major EMM vendors stopped supporting the legacy device admin mode in Android 10. However, Knox Manage kept supporting legacy enrollments for devices with Android 10. With Android 11: New device enrollments: Knox Manage no longer allows deployments to Android Legacy mode. Existing device enrollments:\"Upon firmware update to Android 11, Knox Manage continues to support devices already enrolled as Android Legacy in Android 10 and lower. Since new Knox Manage features and product designs will be focused on Android Enterprise implementations, the support scope for Android Legacy will be limited to bug fixes, and migration to Android Enterprise is highly recommended. Device admin (DA)\"deprecation In Android 10 (Q OS), to encourage migration to Android Enterprise, Google deprecated four key device admin (DA)\"policies that controlled the device camera, password, keyguard, and Wi-fi. Furthermore, by November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. So, from this date onwards, app updates will start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. The Knox Manage v20.11 release no longer supports the four deprecated DA\"policies in Android Legacy mode. Android Legacy > System > Camera , For a Samsung device, the Android policies will be supported constantly by using equivalent Knox policies. For a non-Samsung device, the policies are no longer available and must be released from the policy set before the v20.11 release. Android Legacy > Security > Device Password , For a Samsung device, the Android policies will be supported constantly by using equivalent Knox policies. For a non-Samsung device, these policies are no longer available and must be released from policy set before the v20.11 release. Android Legacy > Security > Device Password > KeyGuard (Block Functions on the Lock Screen) , For both Samsung and non-Samsung devices, the policies are no longer available and must be released from the policy set before the v20.11 release.

As the device is controlled by KM, the user cannot remove the policies or unenroll the device. The device was unenrolled using Force Unenroll without noting the Offline Unenrollment Code. The device never received the command due to a connectivity issue, so it\"is no longer under KM control. How do I find the Offline Unenrollment Code in Knox Manage if the device is still enrolled? To get the Offline Unenrollment Code for an enrolled device: 1. In the Device menu, select Device Name under the device that you want to unenroll. 2. Select Unenroll and the Offline Unenrollment Code shows in a dialog box. If the device is already unenrolled or deleted, the code does not appear in the dialog box. For steps on how to recover the Offline Unenrollment Code for deleted devices, see below. How do I find the Offline Unenrollment Code in Knox Manage if the device was unenrolled and deleted? There are two ways to get the Offline Unenrollment Code for a deleted device: ##Deleted Devices menu In KM 20.11, the Deleted Devices menu was introduced to provide a more convenient way to retrieve the Offline Unenrollment and Exit Kiosk codes, along with unlimited device history and filtering options. To access the Deleted Devices menu: 1. In the sidebar of your KM console, select Device. 2. Click Deleted Devices. ##Audit Log 1. In the sidebar of your KM console, select History > Audit Log. 2. Select a date\"range that includes the Force Unenroll command you sent to the device. 3. Under Event, enter \"Offline Unenrollment Code\" to filter the event results. 4. To search for a specific device's unenrollment code, enter the User ID or Device Name in the filter parameters. 5. Select the expand icon to view the device's Offline Unenrollment Code. You can then share the code with the user to successfully unenroll the disconnected device. The audit logs only show device history up to 90 days old. If a device was removed more than 90 days ago, please use the Deleted Devices menu instead. Related articles For more information on how to unenroll devices, head to the Knox Manage admin guide.",

This knowledge base article provides information on managing personal Gmail accounts in a\"Managed Google Play Store, including how to allow or block users from adding their personal accounts using Knox Manage (KM), and how to restrict users from downloading certain apps. A Managed Google Play Store serves as a content marketplace for devices on Android Enterprise - here, you can browse and manage apps for your organization. Applications that have not been approved or assigned in KM do not appear in a Managed Google Play Store. How do I allow users to download public apps not in the\"Managed Play Store? To download an app from the public Play Store, users must add and switch to a personal Google account on the device. To do this: 1. Navigate to Settings > Accounts and Backup > Accounts. 2. Under Add personal Google account, enter the credentials for your personal Google account. 3. From your work profile, launch the Managed Play Store and switch to your personal Google account. You can now download public apps outside of the Managed Play Store. How can I block users from downloading unapproved applications with a personal Google account in Knox Manage? Currently, there are two methods of preventing users from downloading apps not in the Managed Play Store.\"Adding an \"Account Blocklist\" policy blocks personal Google accounts while allowing other personal accounts (e.g. Outlook) to be added. Alternatively, disabling the \"Account Modification\" policy blocks all personal accounts, including Google accounts, from being added or removed. ##Account Blocklist 1. In your KM console, select Profile > Add to create a new device profile. 2. In the profile settings, ensure Android Enterprise is selected under Platform. 3. In the Set Policy menu, navigate to Android Enterprise > System. 4. Under Account Modification, select Allow. 5.

On the device, launch Samsung Email and add a personal Google account. Launching Managed Play Store on the device shows there are no other linked Google accounts, so the user can only download apps that have been approved for the organization or group.

Introduced in KM version 20.2, the auto-update feature allows you to choose whether or not to update the KM agent automatically on the device. How do I configure the Knox Manage auto-update feature? You can configure auto-update in your KM console by navigating to Setting > Configuration > Knox Manage Agent Policy. If the policy is set to Use, a notification is displayed on the device status bar when a new KM agent version is uploaded. This notification cannot be dismissed by the device user. To use auto-update, your enrolled devices must have a KM version of 20.2 or higher installed. How is a Knox Manage auto-update triggered? There are two events that trigger the KM agent auto-update: 1. When the device receives a profile update, it checks if there is a new version of the KM agent. 2. When the KM agent is launched, the device pulls the app management profile and simultaneously checks for a new agent version. How is a Knox Manage auto-update pushed to a device? While Knox Manage can automatically deliver agent updates to enrolled devices, some user interaction is required to complete the update installation. Depending on how your devices are managed, users are directed to one of two installation paths: ##Android Legacy and Android Enterprise Device Owner (Fully Managed) modes A notification is sent to the device. When the user selects the notification, the update is automatically downloaded and installed. ##Android Enterprise Profile Owner (Work Profile) mode A notification is sent to the device. When the notification is selected, the user is directed to the Google Play Store to install the update. If you have disabled the notification bar through a policy, the user cannot see the update notification. If you are managing a device with a work profile using the Knox Service Plug-in (KSP), the auto-update process is the same as Android Legacy and Android Enterprise Device Owner modes.",

Certificates are commonly used for secure authentication and it is considered more secure than password-based authentication. It can be used via Knox Manage to authenticate users for: Wi-Fi: Authorizes connection. VPN: Authorizes encrypted VPN communication. Exchange: Authorizes the user authentication and services in Exchange. This article shows how to set lock screens manually to allow the installation of external certificates via Knox Manage and confirm that the user certificate is available. Why do I need to set a Lockscreen on devices to install certificates? When installing a certificate on an Android device, it is stored on the Android Keystore system. This system stores cryptographic keys in a secure container and makes it difficult to be extracted. When storing a certificate in Android KeyStore, it is only authorized to be used if the user has been authenticated. The user is authenticated using a subset of their secure lock screen credentials (pattern, PIN, password, or biometric credentials). For more details about the Android Keystore system, please review this article. How do I set Lockscreen on devices manually to install certificates via Knox Manage? 1. To add an external certificate on Knox Manage, please refer to the external certifications documentation. 2. Ensure a certificate is added to the Knox Manage console and a policy that uses the certificate is in place (E.g. To configure a Wi-Fi network with EAP-PEAP authentication using an external certificate in Knox Manage, please refer to this knowledge base article.) 3. From the device side, the user will receive information in the Knox Manage agent to Download configuration. 4. If the device does not have a policy applied to set a lockscreen, user will receive the following pop-up message: 5. At this point, if the user does not set a lock screen password, the certificate will not be installed, due to the keystore being locked. It means that until a lock screen password is configured on the device, the Android platform will not authorize the use of the keystore and the certificate will not be installed. 6. After configuring the lock screen password, the user can check if the user certificate is installed following the path: Settings > Biometrics and security > Other security settings > User certificates.",

There are instances when you might run into an error when trying to enroll more devices, despite having the number of seats needed available: ```prettyprint Failed to Knox License Activation [Enrollment - Update License Request (License Quantity Exhausted)] ``` The error is occurs due to Knox License Manager (KLM) and Samsung License Manager (SLM) license consumption mismatch. The issue happens when devices are improperly enrolled, such as deleting the device from the console or forcing a factory reset. The only way to ensure both KLM and SLM are synced is by unenrolling devices using the unenroll button. When a device gets unenrolled improperly or deleted from the console, Knox Manage acknowledges this change and releases a seat within its licensing system. However, SLM does not check with KM's system, therefore, it will not update to release the same seat(s). During the next enrollment, the system tries to use the key, even though it's still considered full by the other system, resulting in an error. An example of license seat discrepancy within KLM and SLM The number of seats available shown in Knox Manage may look different from the license key page on the Knox Admin Portal, shown in the example below. The Knox Manage portal shows the activated device are 942 out of 1000. However, on the Knox Admin Portal, it shows that there are 1100 activated devices. This causes the user to run into the License Quantity Exhausted error. Knox Manage Knox Admin Portal How do I fix the license seat discrepancy? 1. Get the list of IMEIs which are activated with the license and create a csv file with one IMEI per line. 2. Visit the Keep or Remove Devices page on your samsungknox.com dashboard, where it will ask for the following details: 1. License Key: Copy and paste the license key into the text box. 2. Select Keep between the remove or keep options. 3. Upload the CSV file which you have created in Step 1 and click Submit. These steps will remove all the IMEIs which shouldn't be in the system and vacate the license seats for further use. What if I can't access the \"Keep or Remove Devices\" page?

For Android 9 and lower devices managed with Knox Manage in legacy mode, sending the Update license command sometimes fails after adding the new license to the Knox Manage console, causing devices to maintain the old license and their \"expired\" status. Cause When you send the Update license command, the Knox Manage console starts to sync the license with the expired devices. Then it waits for confirmation that the device user must agree to, confirming the switch to a new license. Within a given timeframe, if no actions are taken from the user, the Knox Manage agent will show a timeout error while waiting for the end-user agreement. On the console, the following errors will appear in the Update license command history when viewing the command in detail: ``` Request History: Result Code: Failed (Internal) Result History: CommandCode=ReportRequest Request History: NotificationId=AASdcf59a714725476ca3f74660c807f1f6, Result Code: Failed (1901035) Result History: EMM Agent error occurred ``` Resolution You should inform the device users about the planned license update and ask them to agree to the license update/sync pop-up once received. If the target devices have their language set to Arabic, the pop-up message will not appear (an upcoming fix is planned for this case). Meanwhile, we suggest changing the device language to English before sending the Update license command.",

This article explains the implementation logic behind KM and KSP, and describes the steps involved with deploying a managed configuration to a device. How the KSP schema/managed configuration is pushed to a device 1. KM sends the KSP schema data to Google (Audit log, Request for Management configuration of Google managed app). When the admin sends a policy from KM to Google, KM creates and updates a unique UUID in the profileName field of the KSP policy to check its transmission history. 2. Google sends the KSP schema to the device, and KSP sends feedback to the KM server (Audit log, Save KSP App feedback). Delays may occur when KSP schema data is delivered from Google to the devices. Changes can take around 1-2 days before being reflected in your devices. 3. When the device's KSP agent receives the new KSP schema, the agent applies the newly updated policies based on the currently applied KSP policies. Based on Google's logic, the managed configuration should be applied with little to no delay, but further delays may occur based on server traffic. If your changes aren't applied after 1-2 days, the cause may be server, internet connectivity, or bug issues.

            "content": "How to enforce a password policy during enrollment for company-owned devices with a Work Profile. If you have a fleet of company-owned Android 11 and higher devices that require Work Profiles and a strict password policy, it's possible for the device user to accidentally render the device or some of its features unusable. During enrollment with a strict password policy, the device prompts the user to set locks for both the personal profile and Work Profile. However, on Android 11 and higher, if the device is rebooted for whatever reason before the locks are set, Managed Google Play functionality might be inhibited, or worse, the device might become bricked. This article provides insights about how to avoid this risk. We highly recommend that you incorporate this information into your enterprise deployment process. How do I enforce a password policy when enrolling a company-owned device with a Work Profile? When a company-owned device with a Work Profile is enrolled with a strict password policy: 1. The device user begins the appropriate enrollment method. 2. The KM agent prompts the device user to set a lock for both the primary profile and Work Profile. The agent provides DEVICE SCREEN LOCK SETTING and WORK PROFILE LOCK SETTING buttons to facilitate this step in the flow. 3. The device user sets both locks, which must comply with the applied password policy. 4. The device user taps Finish on the Finish Setup screen, and the device enrolls. The following scenarios can occur if the device is rebooted before step 2 is complete. Each scenario's consequences and solutions differ depending on the Android version. #The device user doesn't set both locks, and the device is rebooted System , Consequence , Solution - , - , - Android 11 , Android starts without resuming the enrollment process. Neither profile is protected by a lock. The device user must manually set both locks through the default Android and KM methods. Android 12 , The enrollment flow resumes. The device user must set both the locks through the enrollment process. #The device user sets the Work Profile lock, and the device is rebooted System , Consequence , Solution - , - , - Android 11 , Android starts without resuming the enrollment process. Managed Google Play doesn't start or sync the KM profile's apps until the Work Profile is unlocked. The device notifies the user that system setup is still in progress, and when they tap the notification it prompts them to set a lock for the personal profile. The device user must unlock the Work Profile. Android 12 , The device becomes bricked. A support provider must factory reset the device with hardware keys. #The device user sets the Work Profile lock, taps Finish, and the device is rebooted before enrollment completes System , Consequence , Solution - , - , - Android 11 and higher , Android starts without resuming the enrollment process. Managed Google Play doesn't start or sync the KM profile's apps until the Work Profile is unlocked.

            "content": "Apply basic policies. Before setting any policies, ensure you have met the following prerequisites. Refer to your UEM documentation for instructions on how to complete these steps. 1. Your devices are set up in either a DO or PO deployment mode. 2. You have set up a Managed Google Play store. 3. You have added KSP as an approved app. Set a standard policy #Device Owner (DO) This example demonstrates how to use a device-wide (DO) policy that requires a fingerprint as the minimum password strength. This configuration is applied to the entire device. You can repeat this sequence of steps for any policy that falls under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Device Wide Policy Controls. 2. Under Password policy turn on Enable password policy controls with KSP. 3. Under Biometric authentication turn on Enable fingerprint authentication. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 5. Your policies are now applied. #Profile Owner (PO) This example demonstrates how to use a profile-wide policy that disables the Android Allow Share Via feature. The particular policies used in this section require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. You can repeat this step sequence for any policy under the Work profile policies (Profile Owner) category. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Work profile policies (Profile Owner) category, turn on Enable work profile policy controls. 2. Under Device Restrictions turn on Enable device restriction controls. 3. If required, enter your Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium License Key. If your UEM natively supports Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license activation, you don't need to fill out this field. Check with your UEM for more information. 4. Disable Allow Share Via option. 5. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 6. Your policies are now applied. Here is an example of a success message and an error message. The error message occurs if you try to apply a Premium policy to a device without first activating a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license key. Set multiple policy parameters Some policies allow you to select more than one option as a parameter. With these policies, you can individually select which parameters to enable or disable. In some cases, you may need to deselect policy parameters that you do not want to apply. For example, we set the USB exception list to allow only Audio and Human Interface Device. The following image shows a policy with multiple options applied. To revoke multiple polices, simply deselect the polices you want to change and push the updated configuration profile to your devices. Set group policies Some policies are actually a subset of a larger group policy. With these policies, you must enable the group policy before you can modify any individual parameters. For example, we must first turn on Tethering controls before we can access the Allow Wi-Fi tethering and Allow Bluetooth tethering settings. The following image illustrates these settings. Target a specific app To target a specific app, you need to use the app package name in conjunction with a KSP policy. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Enable application management controls. 2. Under Application Management policies, enable Enable application management controls with KSP. 3. Under Battery optimization insert the app package name you want to target, for example, `com.samsung.email.provider`. If you want to add more than one app, enter a comma separated list of package names, for example `com.samsung.email.provider, com.samsung.android.app.notes, com.sec.android.app.voicenote`. If you need to remove an app from a previously applied policy, simply remove the app package from your comma separated list and re-apply the configuration. One way to find an app's package is to search for it on Google Play in a browser. You see the app package appended to the URL in the browser, as seen in the following image. Enforce a password policy The first line of defense on a device is a strong device password. KSP offers granular controls for IT admins to enforce the use of a strong password as well as allow or block other authentication methods on a device. For example, let's turn off biometric authentication methods for devices as well as enforce a specific password policy. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, next to Password Policy, click Configure. 2. On the Password Policy page that opens, set the Enable password policy controls with KSP field to True. 3. Next to the Biometric authentication field, click Configure. 4. On the Biometric authentication page that opens, set all fields to False. Doing so turns off all biometric authentication methods for these devices. Return to the Password policy page. 5. Next to the Password Change field, click Configure. 6. On the page that opens, set the Enforce password change field to True. When you set the Enforce password change field to True, the device user is forced to set up a password - if one was not already set up - or change the password, if a password was previously set on the device. 7. In the Password enforcement timeout field, set a value for the number of minutes up to which the user can cancel or delay the password change. We recommend setting a low value to enforce a password change in a timely fashion. Return to the Password policy page. 8. Next to the Password Restrictions field, click Configure. 9. In the Maximum character sequence length field, set the maximum length of an alphabetic sequence that is allowed for a password. 10. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. Your policy is now updated. Revoke a policy Revoking a policy is simple. All you need to do is find the policy you previously enabled and toggle it back off. For example, let's turn Wi-Fi back on from our previous example. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Device Wide Policy Controls. 2. Find the previous policy you disabled, for example Allow Wi-Fi. 3. Turn Allow Wi-Fi back on. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 5. Your policy is now updated. #Revoke a group of policies You can also revoke an entire group of polices if you turn off the respective group control flag. For example, if you turn off Enable device restriction controls, then all device restrictions are revoked. In addition, if a policy that is related to a configuration is disabled, all the configuration is revoked. For example, if Customize DeX Experience is turned off , then all settings applied from the DeX customization profile are revoked. Test and debug policies To test your polices, you use a feature called Debug mode. 1. Turn on Debug mode. 2. Set or update the policies you need. 3. Push the policies to a device. 4. Check the KSP app for debug information. Tips on successful KSP deployments 1. Deploy payloads gradually. 2. Add only a small number of policy changes at a time. Push , Test , Ensure success 3. Disable debug mode in production after testing. 4. Assign unique profile names in KSP. Settings can be configured in 2 main areas - the Device wide policies (DO and WP-C) and the Work profile policies (PO). The sections below these DO and PO configurations are sub sections of the policy, and usually need to be enabled in the DO or PO prior to being configured in the policy. Inside of each section of the policy, there are typically switches that turn on individual settings. During configuration, make sure not to navigate back in your web browser, or you will lose your progress. If the EMM console splits into different sections, use the navigation controls inside the EMM to navigate. Navigation specifics vary based on your EMM.",

Knox Service Plugin is an app that lets you use Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) features to administer, configure, and secure Samsung devices, as soon as the features are available through a Knox Platform for Enterprise release. As an IT admin, you are able to use the latest Knox features on the day they are launched, instead of needing to develop your own solution using the Samsung Knox SDK, or waiting for your UEM provider to integrate the features. Why use Knox Service Plugin? Here's a simple example to explain how Knox Service Plugin can help you: Let's say that Knox Platform for Enterprise introduces the capability for Samsung devices to translate speech to any language in real time. James, an IT admin for his global organization, thinks that would be a very useful feature to deploy to his team's devices, but his team doesn't include a software developer to make use of the Knox SDK to incorporate the feature. James contacts a developer at his UEM provider, Leonard, to ask when the new feature might be integrated into the UEM's console. Leonard tells James that the new feature won't be included in their UEM console for many months. Undeterred, James remembers that he doesn't need to wait for Leonard to implement the new feature. Instead, he can add the Knox Service Plugin app to his UEM. With the plugin installed, new features introduced in Knox Platform for Enterprise are available in his UEM console the same day, and James can enable the translation feature on his team's devices right away. Benefits of using Knox Service Plugin Knox Service Plugin lets IT admins use Knox Platform for Enterprise features as soon as they're available. Knox Platform for Enterprise brings defense-grade security on the most popular consumer devices across all enterprises. It provides best-in-class hardware-based security, policy management, and compliance capabilities beyond the standard features in Android. Knox is the cornerstone of a strong mobile security strategy supporting a wide variety of Samsung devices. Knox Service Plugin provides the following benefits: Helps enterprise customers deploy existing and new Knox features to their devices almost instantly after features are commercially launched. Leverages the UEM's framework and UI to offer enterprise customers better control over distribution and configuration of Knox Platform for Enterprise features. Makes sure all Knox Platform for Enterprise features are available for use, regardless of which UEM you choose. Minimizes a UEM's development cost of supporting Knox Platform for Enterprise features.",

As an IT admin, you can map the power (side) key on non-rugged devices to launch an app. For example, you could press the side key to launch the Walkie Talkie app in Microsoft Teams for push-to-talk (PTT) capability. This intent doesn't replace the intents available for rugged devices, but instead works in tandem with them. For general information on device key mapping, go to Device key mapping overview. For information on device key mapping for rugged devices, go to Device key mapping for rugged devices. Map the side key For the side key mapping to work properly, you must disable the Bixby package and configure the side key press-and-hold setting, as described in the following procedure. 1. Deploy a compatible push-to-talk (PTT) app with your UEM through Managed Google Play. 2. Deploy the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) app through your UEM. 3. Obtain a Samsung Knox license on the Knox Admin Portal, or use an existing Knox or Knox Suite license. 4. Create and deploy the KSP PTT policy with your UEM to configure keys and disable the Bixby packages. For example: Disable Bixby: In your UEM, there should be a configuration setting that lets you disable an app without the device user's input. In this setting, enter com.samsung.android.bixby.agent. Add your PTT intents: Under Device-wide policies, turn on Enable device policy controls. Then, under Device Key Mapping, turn on Enable Key Mapping. Your UEM should have configuration settings similar to Intent for Key press and Intent for Key release. The two relevant button intents are preloaded by default, but you can change their names: com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.SIDE_PRESS com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.SIDE_RELEASE , Only use the long press intent. The short press intent may turn the device screen off or on. Press corresponds to key down, and release corresponds to key up. 5. Configure the policy for the side key menu item: 1. In your UEM, add a new setting menu item, for example, using a configuration option such as Configure a setting menu item. 2. Name this new menu item. For example, Side key > Press and hold. 3.

These policies are listed under DO > DeX policy > Manage DeX restrictions. Customization controls - These additional customization options allow you to change the DeX setup and user experience. Use of these policies requires a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Enable DeX The process to enable DeX is simple and only requires you to turn on a few policies as follows: 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. To disable DeX, simply turn off Allow DeX connection, as shown in the previous example. Enable DeX with basic customization This example shows you how to enable DeX so it auto-launches and sets a specific screen timeout. Note that all DeX customization policies require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Enable DeX policy. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under DeX customization profile, enable Auto-start DeX on HDMI connection. 5. Under DeX customization profile, find Set screen timeout and input your desired value. 6. Under DeX customization profile, disable Allow screen timeout change. 7. The device now launches DeX automatically when it is plugged in to an HDMI cable. 8. Once the device is connected to DeX, a Display resolution screen displays. Select a single resolution value for the connected display. Unselected display options will be greyed out and unavailable. Keep in mind, changing the resolution makes displayed windows, text and other items appear small or larger. Options include, WQHD (2560 x 1440), FHD (1920 x 1080) _recommended setting_, HD+ (1600 x 900), WQXGA (2560 x 1600), WUXGA (1920 x 1200), or UWQHD (3440 x 1440). Select Done to commit the selected display setting. If the display resolution provided is not supported, then FHD (1920 x 1080) is selected by default and non-supported resolutions are greyed out in the DeX Display resolution screen. Industry example This example configures a tablet in DeX mode, so a bank employee can use it to help customers with day to day operations. For example opening a new account or checking account balances. In this use case, DeX is used as a dedicated employee work station and the bank can slowly phase out older, single-purpose computer terminals. These instructions do not apply to any specific UEM. Refer to your UEM documentation for specific instructions on menu structure and navigation. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under DeX Policy, turn on Enable DeX policy controls. 3. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Allow DeX connection. 4. Under Manage DeX Restrictions, enable Customize DeX Experience. 5. Set the DeX profile name to an appropriate value. For example, the following image shows a profile called Bank Terminal. 6. Under DeX customization profile, type the name of the DeX Profile you set in the previous step. In this example, it is Bank Terminal 7. Under DeX customization profile, enable DeX Auto Start on HDMI connection This setting minimizes potential troubleshooting for employees and can reduce IT overhead. If a device is unplugged, setting up the bank terminal again is as simple as plugging the device back in to an HDMI cable. 8. Under DeX customization profile, enable Disable buttons on the DeX panel. Select the buttons you want to disable. For example, selecting Exit DeX button prevents users from exiting the bank terminal and using the device for other purposes. 9. Under DeX customization profile, turn on Skip overscan detection screen. The overscan screen is a setting that automatically tries to optimize the UI according to the monitor you are using. This setting is unnecessary for this use-case. 10. Under DeX customization profile, enable Add application shortcuts on DeX. You can now add relevant bank services that employees need to use to the DeX homescreen. To do add apps, list the app packages in the App package name dialog. 11. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. 12. Once configured and pushed to a device, DeX auto launches with your company profile and policies applied. DeX Customization features do not always return errors in debug mode. This omission can happen if your device may not have the correct OS or DeX version installed. If the framework on your device does not support your policies, then they are not applied.",

To set a unique device password policy: 1. In your UEM console, open the Device Configuration Profile associated with your target devices, and then on the middle navigation menu, click Properties. The Device Configuration Policy Properties page opens. 2. On the Properties page, in the Settings list, click Configure. The OEMConfig page for the Device Configuration Policy opens. 3. Next to the appropriate Profile Owner or Device Owner field, click Configure. 4. Navigate to one of the following Password Policy fields as needed. Click Configure. Once the updates have been completed, click OK. Updated password settings are saved and deployed to devices based on the deployment schedule. Set the Enable password policy controls with KSP value to True to permit the management of password policies on a device. Enable this option before changing any of the device's password settings. If this option is not set to True, then any password or user authentication settings are ignored. Refer to the following Biometric authentication options to use personal traits (fingerprints, iris, and facial recognition) as device user authenticators. Consider biometric authenticators as an alternative to traditional passwords that are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing attempts and duplication. Enable fingerprint authentication - Set this value to True to permit the use of fingerprint recognition as a device user authenticator. Enable Iris authentication - Set this value to True to permit the use of an iris as a device user authenticator. Iris scanning measures the unique patterns in the human iris (the colored circles in the eye). The iris scanner then creates a digital representation of the data and store it in a database for potential use as a user authenticator. Enable Face recognition - Set this value to True to utilize a digital image of a device user's face as an authenticator. An authentication request matches the user's facial image with the image stored in the database before device access is granted. If a lock is set in DO and it is using P/P/P authentication, the user should not be able to use facial authentication in PO. Set the Enable multifactor authentication value to True to enable multifactor authentication (2FA), enforcing a device unlock only after two successful authentication methods are provided. If enabling multifactor authentication, one authentication method must be biometric (fingerprint, iris, or face), and the other must be a lock screen method (PIN, password, or pattern). Multifactor authentication is only supported on Knox 3.2.1 and above devices. Keep in mind, the incorrect use of multifactor authentication with \"One lock\" and a biometric policy could result in a locked device requiring qualified support assistance to unlock. Refer to the following Password change options to enforce how device users set their login password and the interval it is changed: Set the Enforce Password Change value to True to force the user to change their password the next time they login to their device. If no password has been set, use this option to force the user to create a password. Verify existing password enforcement conditions before setting this value to True to ensure password enforcement changes do not occur at an unexpected time. If unsure, set this value to False. Configure a Password Enforcement timeout \\ to define the maximum number of minutes a device user can wait to cancel or delay a password change. Refer to the following Policy Restriction settings to manage various password complexity characteristics: Set the Maximum Character Sequence Length \\ to define the maximum alphanumeric character sequence permitted for a device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on alphanumeric sequence length. Set the Maximum Numeric Sequence Length \\ to specify the maximum numeric sequence length permitted for a device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on numeric sequence length. Set the Minimum Password Length \\ to specify the minimum number of characters permitted for the device password. The larger the number, the greater potential strength of the device password. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction. Define the Allowed Time for User Activity before Device Locks to set the maximum number of milliseconds \\ for user activity before the device will lock. A value of zero (0) means no activity restrictions are in place. Set the Maximum Failed Password Attempts to Wipe Data to define the number of failed password attempts \\ allowed before the data on the device is wiped and rendered unavailable. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on the number of failed login attempts. Keep in mind, the string provided via the API takes effect immediately, with no chance to revert the data once the defined number of password attempts is exceeded. Enter the Maximum Failed Password Attempts to Disable Work Profile to set the number of failed password attempts \\ before the work profile and device itself are disabled. Once disabled, the device user is unable to restore the device with the password, and an administrator must re-enable the device. A value of zero (0) means there is no restriction on the number of failed login attempts. Refer to the Define Password Quality value to select the level of complexity required when setting a device's work profile password. From No Password to Complex Password (letter, numeric and alphanumeric characters required). A Numeric Complex password must include numeric characters with no repeating or ordered integers. Options include: No Password , Some Password , Numeric , Alphabet , Alphanumeric , Numeric Complex , Complex , Use the Disable Keyguard Feature to select the specific Keyguard feature to disable. Keyguard is the code utilized in a device unlock operation. Options include None and Disable Trusted Agents. Set the Password Visibility control to True to enable the ability to hide the password from view when entered on the device. Setting this control to False disables the ability to hide the password when entered, and provides no additional security.",

Depending upon your network and security needs, you can enable or disable UCM policies as well as configure advanced settings for your UCM plugins. Before you can enable UCM plugins for your devices, you must create and configure at least one UCM configuration policy. 1. Create UCM configuration policy The following example describes the process to create a new UCM configuration policy, called Screen lock, that dictates how the UCM plugin restricts access to specific apps on the target device when the device is locked. 1. In your UEM console, open the Device Configuration Profile that is associated with your target devices > click the appropriate option to edit the profile. 2.

Always choose a name that highlights the main feature or use of the UCM plugin configuration that you are setting up. You can then reference this name in KSP to apply these settings to the target device. 2. In the Package name of UCM plugin application field, enter the package name for your UCM vendor's application. Sample format is `com.mycompany.ucm.plugin`. Refer to the UCM vendor application's Google Play Store page for the correct package name. 3. In the Credential usage list, select Screen lock. 4. If your UCM vendor's plugin supports PIN caching, in the Pin properties area > in the PIN timeout type list > select Same as screen lock. The UCM plugin now requires re-authentication whenever the screen locks. 5. In the Application access controls area > Type of access restrictions list > select Unrestricted access. 6. In the Access control when device or workspace is locked area > Lock credential storage when device or workspace is locked list > click True. 7. In the List of apps allowed to access credential storage when locked field, enter the package names - in a comma-separated list - to allow specific apps to access UCM credential storage when the device is locked. 8. List of certificates to install on this credential storage after configuration. 5. Click OK to save this new UCM configuration. This UCM configuration restricts all apps' access to UCM credential storage, with the exception of specific apps, when the device is locked. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for each type of UCM configuration policy you want to create in your Device Configuration Profile. 2. Use an existing UCM configuration policy The following example shows you how to use the Screen lock UCM configuration policy that you created earlier to automatically secure target devices in the High security devices device group when the screen is locked. 1. After you've created the Screen lock UCM configuration policy in your chosen Device Configuration Policy, go to Groups > All groups. 2. On the All groups page, confirm that the High security devices device group exists. Refer to your UEM console's help documentation for information on creating a new or editing an existing device group. 3. Go to the Device Configuration Policy that contains the Screen lock UCM configuration policy > click Assignments > Include tab. 4. On the Include page, in the Assign to list, select High security devices > click Save. 5. Depending upon the settings you've chosen for deploying Device Configuration Policy changes, the new UCM Configuration Policy is deployed on the devices in the High security devices group.",

For this example, we select Knox built-in, which uses the Android VPN Management for Knox VPN. 3. Under Host, list your server host IP, for example, `52.3.256.0`. 4. Leave all other values as default. 5. In your UEM, save the profile. Configure VPN Vendor parameters Now that you have created a VPN profile, you can set up the parameters such as the identifier and pre-shared key. Following the previous example, continue to configure Android VPN Management for Knox VPN. 1. Under Parameters for Knox built-in VPN, Authentication type select `ipsec_ike2_rsa.` 2. Under User certificate alias, enter your certificate name. For example: `md_user.pfx`. 3. Under CA certificate alias, enter your certificate name. For example: `vpn_cal.pfx`. 4. Leave all other values as default. 5. In your UEM, save the profile. If you are using a different VPN, such as Pulse Secure or Cisco AnyConnect, these values may differ. The mandatory parameters you need to set depend on your network configuration. Contact your Network Administrator to find out which fields to use and with what values. Enable VPN policy Now that you have created and configured a profile, configure a policy and push it to a target device. 1. In your supported UEM, under the Device-wide policies (Device Owner) category, turn on Enable device policy controls. 2. Under VPN policy, turn on Enable VPN controls. 3. Under VPN type, choose Selected Apps (Per-App). Currently, KSP does not support per-app the VPN mode for Net Motion VPN. 4. Under Manage list of apps that use VPN, add the package names of the apps you want to route through the VPN. For example, `com.samsung.email.provider`. If you do not enter any app packages, the VPN applies to all apps by default. 5. Enter the Name of VPN profile to use, for this example we use our Android VPN Management for Knox profile `VPN_Knox`. 6. Leave all the other VPN values as set by default. 7. In your UEM, save the profile and push it to a device. Within the VPN policy, optionally enable USB tethering over VPN so an allow listed USB device can access and share resources with a peer device. Admins can ensure there is security-based certification available so only a designated organization, or user, can use VPN tethering with allowed devices. However, VPN tethering will only work when the following conditions are met: An IT admin must allow this feature from their UEM console for a target device to receive the tethering feature. A user must enable VPN tethering on their device. The laptop or tablet being connected must have been previously allow listed by the IT admin. The maximum number of VPN connections does not exceed 2. USB tethering over VPN is only supported on Knox 3.5 and above devices. A wrong VPN configuration can disconnect your device or work profile from the network, and in some cases render it unrecoverable. To avoid this issue, Samsung recommends keeping the following applications out of the VPN configuration: UEM Agent package - Check with your UEM for details. KSP package - `com.samsung.android.knox.kpu`, Google services - `com.android.vending, com.google.android.gms` Use the Manage list of apps that can bypass VPN setting to list theses packages.",

Samsung devices that support Knox and run Android 9 or higher. 2. A Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solution that supports Android Enterprise deployments and is compatible with KSP. 3. A valid Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) license for each of the devices managed with KSP. For more information about Knox licenses, see Knox Platform for Enterprise licenses. 4. You must set up your devices in one of the supported Android Enterprise deployments, as described in the following section. Supported deployments The first step to deploy a KSP policy is to create a DO or PO profile on your device. Without choosing one or the other, policies do not work and an error message is thrown. In an enterprise deployment, Google provides three modes of Android Enterprise, fully managed (DO), work profile (PO), and fully managed with a work profile. Work Profile - Helps admins manage the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) use case, where a device user owns the device and uses it both personally and for work. The agent sits inside the container area as Profile Owner (PO) to separate work apps from personal apps. IT admins can control the work area only, and have no visibility over or access to the personal area. Managed Device - Also known as Company Owned, Business Only (COBO); helps admins manage devices that are owned by the enterprise. When a device is enrolled as a Managed Device, IT admins have full control over the device. The agent sits as Device Owner (DO) of the device. Work Profile on Company Owned Devices - Also known as Corporate Owned, Managed Profile (COMP) on Android 10, and WP-C (starting Android 11+) are company-owned devices that are personally enabled, with a container that is managed by PO. This deployment type targets enterprise-owned devices that require a separation of work and personal data. Employees can use these devices for either work or personal purposes. For more information, refer to Work profile enhancements for company-owned devices. #KSP works with the following Android Enterprise deployment modes: Android 9.0, 10.0 - Fully managed device - Device Owner (DO), Work Profile - Profile Owner (PO), fully managed device with a Work Profile, and Android dedicated devices (COSU) (Corporate-Owned Single Use) mode. Android 11 and higher - Fully managed device - Device Owner (DO), Work Profile on personally owned devices (PO), Work Profile on company-owned devices (WP-C), and Android dedicated devices (COSU). Refer to your respective EMM configuration guide for information on provisioning dedicated devices (COSU). Supported features Your deployment must use policy configurations that Knox Service Plugin supports. Knox Service Plugin inherits its policies from the Knox Platform for Enterprise framework. These policies can be either standard or premium features. Premium features require a free Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. Supported UEMs You need a UEM that supports Android Enterprise based deployments, device management APIs, and complies with the OEMConfig specification. Check with your UEM vendor to confirm which version of the UEM console you need to use with Knox Service Plugin. Some UEMs offer more than one console, and some consoles may not support Knox Service Plugin. For information about configuring UEMs, see Set up with a UEM. All UEM partners continue to support KPE through their console. Customers need to use KSP only if their UEM solution provider does not support a Knox feature they plan to use. For more information, see Which policy should I use if duplicate policies exist?.",

            "content": "How Knox Service Plugin works. This document is intended for: System architects - Understand how Knox Service Plugin works, and how you can use it to customize your deployment of Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE). IT admins - Configure the options available to Knox Platform for Enterprise deployments using Knox Service Plugin. How Knox Service Plugin works Knox Service Plugin is built on top of Android's standard called OEMConfig. OEMConfig is a feature that lets you create and remotely push configurations to apps through an XML schema file that is hosted in an app on Google Play. This architecture means that any UEM that complies with the OEMConfig standard can support Knox Service Plugin. Here is an overview of how Knox Service Plugin works. 1. App developers implement logic to support managed configurations in their apps. They use an XML schema file to define which app settings IT admins can remotely configure in their Android app. This schema is linked to the app's manifest file. After each update, app developers push their app to Managed Google Play. 2. UEM developers pull the managed configuration schemas from apps on Managed Google Play. UEM consoles then use these XML schemas to allow IT admins to specify how they want to configure app settings. After the IT admin saves their configuration, the UEM pushes the configuration to Managed Google Play. 3. Once an app configuration is updated and pushed to Managed Google Play, the app is updated on all applicable devices to reflect the new configuration. The following image is an example of a Knox Service Plugin policy in a UEM console. The implementation, appearance, and menu structure of how these policies look varies depending upon your UEM and its console. For UEM-specific help, refer to your UEM vendor's documentation. Deployment process The Knox Service Plugin deployment process is as follows: 1. Samsung publishes the latest Knox Service Plugin app to Google Play. 2. IT admins use their compatible UEM console - that supports a managed Google Play store - to search for Knox Service Plugin. For a list of UEM partners that support Knox Service Plugin, see Supported UEMs. 3. The UEM Console renders the applicable Knox features and policies using OEMConfig. 4. IT admins use the UEM\"console to set up policies in the form of managed configurations. These policies are then saved and published to any managed enterprise devices. 5. When a user's device is being provisioned, the UEM invokes the managed Google Play Store, which in turn installs Knox Service Plugin and pushes the managed configuration to the device. 6. After installation is complete, Knox Service Plugin runs in the background on the device. Knox Service Plugin applies the relevant Knox policies and returns the result of the configuration process using Google's Feedback SDK. 7. IT admins can view any configuration failures and associated error messages on the UEM Console, provided the UEM is equipped to handle the result that KSP generates and sends back using the feedback SDK.",

            "content": "Schema structure. This section provides an overview of the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) schema structure and general best practices. The following image shows the high level categories of policies and common configurations. It has four main components: 1. Basic elements - General operational controls for KSP. For example, turn on debug mode or input a KPE license key. 2. Device-wide policies section - Device Owner (DO) policy controls. These are of global scope. 3. Work profile policies section - Profile Owner (PO) policy controls. These apply to only the . 4. Configurations - Specific configuration properties that are used in conjunction with policy controls. For example, VPN profile settings, APN settings, or DeX customization settings. These can be used on either device-wide policies or work profile policies. Schema breakdown #Common configurations Each version of Knox Service Plugin includes a few common options. The features available within these options depend upon your Knox Service Plugin deployment mode, Knox Platform for Enterprise license status - whether you have a Standard or a Premium license - as well as the features available on your UEM console. Device key mapping can be supported using either a KPE Premium, Knox Suite*, or Knox Platform for Customization (KPC) license. \\* For information on Knox Suite, go to: Knox Suite. KPC is a light version of KPE focusing on customization capabilities. These common options are as follows: 1. Profile name - A unique nickname you provide for a set of policy configurations. You can create many different profile names for various sets of configurations. Later, you can use the name for tracking and debugging purposes. We recommend using a name less than 50 characters in length, for example, `MyEnterprise Profile`. 2. KPE Premium License key - This is useful for consoles that do not have Knox Premium License activation built in as a native feature. When this field is used, KSP can activate the license for you when you push the configuration. If your UEM console has already activated a Knox Premium License on your device, there is no need to activate a license using this field. The following image is an example of this field. You only need to input a license if you are using a premium policy. If you do not provide a license key and use a premium policy - or the key provided does not have necessary privileges - the KSP policy fails and produces an error message. 3. Debug modes - When you turn on debug mode, you can view policy results and errors on the device through an app menu. We recommend enabling this mode only during test phases and not during final deployment. If you run into any KSP deployment issues, check this box to enable debug mode and try to perform the action again. You can also export the message and reach out to Knox Support for help to diagnose and fix your issue. 4. DO and PO policies - Depending upon your deployment mode, you need to enable device-wide or Work profile-wide policy controls. Do as follows: Device-wide policies - To enable or disable device-wide policies, use the Enable device policy controls field. Enable this option before using any of the Device-wide policies. If this option is disabled, KSP does not apply any policies in default user (User 0). Work profile-wide policies - To enable or disable Work profile-wide policies, use the Enable work profile policy controls field. Enable this option before using any of the Device-wide policies. If this setting is disabled, KSP does not apply any policy changes inside the Work Profile. #Group policy control flag Every group has a control that enables or disables that policy group. By default every policy group is disabled. You must enable this control before setting any policy in the group. For example, before using any policy in the device-wide policy section, turn on the Enable device-wide policies control first. Further more, to use any device restrictions within the device-wide policy section, turn on Enable device restriction controls and then activate individual policies, such as Allow microphone, Allow Wi-Fi and so on. Control groups are mandatory. Incorrect control group settings or deleting them from input configuration causes KSP to revoke policies or not process policies in that group. The following image illustrates a control group. #Profile Configurations You can save a group of configurations using a Profile Name. Once you save a group of configurations, you can reuse these configurations for as many deployments as you need. For example, in the following image, we have set the DeX profile name as `DeX profile 1`. Any configurations set are saved under the name `DeX profile 1`. When setting policies later, you can reference `DeX profile 1` to quickly set up devices with your saved configurations. Recommended practices , Auto-install - Turn this feature on if your UEM supports it. This feature ensures all devices install KSP automatically when prompted. Auto-update - Turn this feature on if your UEM supports it. This feature ensures that the KSP app is up to date on deployed devices. KSP is designed to be backward compatible. For example, a newer version of the app can handle older schema data, but older app versions can't handle new schema data. Native console policies - Use your UEM console for any policy that is supported natively and use KSP to bridge any gaps. Test in small batches - Always test your KSP schema changes with a limited set of devices, debug the issues (if any) by enabling debug mode, then roll out to wider deployment. Special cases #List applications Some fields allow you to specify more than one app to target. For example: when you select apps to allowlist for a proxy. To list out apps, use a comma-separated list of packages. For example `com.samsung.android.email.provider, com.sec.android.app.sbrowser`. To find a package name, look at the Google Play store URL or contact the app vendor. #Uploading files Some Knox policies, such as DeX customization, require you to provide bulk data, such as an image file. However, OEMConfig specifications do not currently support file upload. If you need to upload a file you can use one of the following two methods: Web URL - Upload the file to a cloud server and provide the web URL as an input string to KSP. Ensure that the URL is publicly accessible. Some UEMs have a limitation on the number of characters you can enter in a string field. In such cases, you cannot use this approach to upload files. Push the image file to the local storage - Use the UEM console to push the image file to the local storage on the device and provide the file path on the device as the input string to KSP. Contact your UEM vendor to find out if they support this feature. Push the image to your device before you install KSP and it attempts to apply any policies to the device.",

            "content": "STIG configurations. This section describes the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) configurations and guidelines that devices need to meet in government and defense agencies. Devices that meet these configurations ensure the maximum protection for sensitive and confidential data as well as improve the security of information systems. As compliance with STIG requires the application of a wide range of configurations, Knox Service Plugin (KSP) attempts to fulfill a set of configurations that the UEM does not support natively. Policies supported by Android Enterprise are not supported by KSP. Overview The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration standards and technical guidance to lock down Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance (IA) enabled devices, information systems, and software that might otherwise become vulnerable to malicious computer attacks. The STIGs are created by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in collaboration with device vendors. Samsung works with DISA to produce a STIG with the specific configuration and technical guidance that defines how organizations can deploy Samsung devices with a required security posture for use within the DoD. #Samsung's STIG For a list of most recently available STIGs, Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDFPPs), and Approved Product List (APL), go to: https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/knox-certifications. The Samsung Android STIGs covers both Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO), and the fully managed device with a work profile use cases. UEMs can deploy these use cases in one of two ways: KPE (AE) - Knox Platform for Enterprise with Android Enterprise, current deployment model , KPE (Legacy) - previous deployment model, which is marked for deprecation DISA recommends that DoD mobile service providers support KPE (AE) deployments to the maximum extent possible. The KPE\"(AE) deployment model complies with DISA's requirements using a UEM that supports AE policies, as well as the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) for additional KPE specific policies necessary for compliance. KSP can configure KPE specific policies for KPE (AE) deployments. KSP does not support KPE (Legacy) based deployments. Please note, UEMs may support KPE specific policies natively, in such case IT Admin may use either UEM or KSP to apply such policies. STIG requirements #Company Owned Business Only (COBO) Fully Managed Devices - also known as Company Owned Business Only (COBO) - are devices owned by the company. Such devices are set up to give IT admins control over an extended range of device settings and additional policy controls. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully\"managed device, go to: STIG compliance for a fully managed device. Before devices are considered STIG-compliant, these devices must meet the following prerequisites: The Samsung Android device must be one of those listed on the APL , The device must be enrolled in the UEM as a fully Managed device , Managed Google Play must be configured , Using managed Google Play, the UEM Administrator must install KSP on the device , A free KPE Premium License must be activated either within the UEM console, or KSP , The UEM administrator must apply the policies listed in the COBO KPE(AE) configuration table , The STIG configuration must match the version of Android OS installed on the device , The COBO KPE(AE) configuration table document contains only one table, \"Table 1: COBO configuration policy rules for Device-Wide Work Environment\" which contains policies that must be applied to the fully managed device , AE policies must be applied using the UEM console , KPE policies must be applied using KSP managed configuration , Appropriate STIG\"policies are applied to the device. For information on applying COBO-specific STIG policies, go to: STIG compliance for COBO devices. #Fully managed device with a work profile Fully managed work profile devices allow work apps and data to be stored in a separate, self-contained space within a device. An employee can continue to use their device as normal; all their personal apps and data remain on the device's primary profile. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully\"managed device with a work profile, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile. Before devices are considered STIG-compliant, these devices must meet the following pre-requisites: The Samsung Android device must be one of those listed on the APL , The device must be enrolled in the UEM as a fully managed device with managed Profile , Managed Google Play must be configured (in the managed Profile) , The UEM Administrator must install two instances of KSP: 1. Using the UEM console, the UEM Administrator must install KSP as a private or internal app within the \"personal\" side of the managed device 2. Using managed Google Play, the UEM Administrator must install KSP within the managed Profile Ensure that the KSP version installed within the Personal profile of the managed device is the same or higher than the KSP version installed within the Managed Work profile. KPE Premium License is activated within the UEM console or using KSP in the managed Work profile. The fully managed device with a work profile KPE (AE) configuration document contains two tables, namely - Table 1: Configuration policy rules for Non-Work environment and Table 2: Configuration policy rules for Work environment. The UEM administrator must apply the policies listed in these two tables as follows: The STIG configuration must match the version of Android OS installed on the device , Apply policies from Table 1: Configuration policy rules for Non-Work Environment to the Personal side of the fully managed device , Apply policies from Table 2: Configuration policy rules for Work Environment the Work profile within the managed device , Apply AE policies using the UEM console. Apply KPE policies using the KSP managed configurations. Appropriate STIG\"policies are applied to the device. For information on applying specific STIG policies, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed device with a work profile. #Using the UEM and KSP to apply STIG policies STIG compliance requires devices to meet strict security requirements. While the actual labels and naming conventions for each of these policies differ for each UEM console, the restrictions that are applicable for each individual policy remain the same irrespective of the UEM used.

For detailed information on configuring STIG policies using your UEM, see your UEM's help documentation. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for a fully managed device, go to: STIG compliance for a fully managed device. To apply STIG compliance policies to COBO devices do as follows: 1. Set up COBO mode on your UEM console. 2. Implement COBO method of AE deployment on your devices. 3. Add KSP as an app in primary profile (DO). 4. Create new DO profiles with appropriate policy restrictions as described in the Configure policies section of the KSP Admin Guide. 5. In your UEM console, navigate to the Device Profiles page. The navigation method and path you need to follow to open the Device Profiles page differs for each UEM. For example, the path for Microsoft Intune is as follows: Devices Profiles & Resources Profiles. Refer to your UEM console's help documentation for detailed information about your UEM's UI. 6. On this page, click Add > Add profile. The select platform to start page opens. 7. On this page, double-click Android. The Add a New Android Profile page opens to show a left navigation menu of items you can configure for your device profile. 8. Using the items on the left navigation menu, edit the STIG compliance policies for COBO devices. See Settings for STIG compliance. Save your changes. 9. Enable audit logging as follows: 1. From the UEM console home page, go to Devices > Device Settings > Android > Intelligent Hub Settings > Samsung Knox settings. 2. Set the value of the Enable Audit Logging field to Enabled. 3.

This section provides high-level instructions to set up and configure STIG policies on a fully managed device with a work profile using VMware Workspace ONE UEM console. For detailed information on configuring STIG policies using VMware Workspace ONE UEM console, see VMware AirWatch v9.x MDM STIG. To reference a video describing STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile, go to: STIG compliance for fully managed devices with a work profile. For information on how to configure VMware Workspace One, see VMware Workspace One and Knox Platform for Enterprise, User Guide VMware Workspace ONE UEM does not currently provide native support for all STIG policies necessary for compliance. IT admins can use KSP from within Workspace ONE to ensure compliance with STIG policies. Currently, you can create a Personal space - also known as Personal profile in Android Enterprise - on fully managed device with a work profile using VMware Workspace ONE UEM, but cannot use KSP to apply additional policies to the Personal space. This results in an inability to use KSP to enforce STIG compliance for Personal space policies. To apply STIG compliance policies: 1. Set the fully managed device with a work profile mode on your UEM console. 2. Implement the fully managed device with a work profile method of AE deployment on your devices. 3. Add KSP as an app in DO and PO. 4. Create new DO and PO profiles with appropriate policy restrictions. 5. In your UEM console, go to Devices > Profiles & Resources > Profiles. The Profiles page opens. 6. On this page, click Add > Add profile. The select platform to start page opens. 7. On this page, double-click Android.

App version , 1.4.24 - September 8th, 2023 Mandatory fields for Wi-Fi Enterprise Configuration policy The Android project has updated the requirements of Wi-Fi Enterprise configurations. For Android 14 and higher, the CA certificate alias and domain name are now required fields in the configuration, whereas previously they could be left unset. For Knox Service Plugin, this underlying system change affects the Wi-Fi Enterprise Configuration policy, which is a member of a Wi-Fi Configuration. The corresponding fields that are affected are CA Certificate for the CA certificate alias, and Domain Name. If you apply the Wi-Fi Enterprise Configuration policy in your fleet deployment, the Knox Service Plugin team urges you to update your Knox Service Plugin profile or payload. If these fields are unset, the policy will no longer take effect. See the description of Wi-Fi Configuration in the Knox Service Plugin policy schema for all of its component policies and fields. General availability of the Data Roaming Policy November 2nd, 2023 update So as to ensure reliability and avoid unexpected behavior, the Allow data roaming policy was disabled with the Knox Service Plugin 1.4.32 hotfix. Read its release notes for more details. In Knox Service Plugin 23.06, the Data Roaming Policy previously underwent a limited release for certain on-premises solutions. As of 23.09, it's now available for all EMMs and cloud solutions. For the Turn on data roaming policy to take effect, the Allow data roaming policy must be enabled.

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Debug mode. We understand that successfully deploying your policies and settings correctly is important. To help you test and deploy your configurations, Knox Service Plugin (KSP) includes a setting called Debug mode. Overview By default, KSP runs in the background and does not have a UI. Debug mode enables you to easily see policy results and errors on a device, so you can verify that your configurations are correct. When turned on, it launches an app that displays the status of policies. This app should auto-launch when it receives any new polices. We recommend you use Debug mode with a limited number of devices. You should turn it off for full deployments. Here's what debug mode looks like when opened manually on a device: The app provides a list of the polices that you have pushed, along with details about the last configuration, including: Policy title - Name of the policy. Message - Description of the policy, along with the status of the policy application. Activate Debug mode Debug mode is activated inside your UEM console, in the Knox Service Plugin configuration area. The location and appearance of the Debug mode feature in your UEM console may vary depending upon your UEM UI. Here is an example of how it may look: Once you activate debug mode within your UEM, the next time policy changes are pushed to a device, the KSP app opens on the device. For example, if you are trying to debug the Enable fingerprint authentication feature, follow these steps in your UEM: 1. Turn on the Debug mode flag. 2. Expand Device-wide policies, and set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Password Policy > Biometric authentication, configure the Enable fingerprint authentication policy. 4. Push the policies to a device. 5. Check the KSP app for debug information. If, for any reason, the app does not launch: Confirm that the device is using the latest Google Play services and Play client application. Confirm that the UEM has pushed the appropriate policies to the device. Some UEMs have a delay between the time a policy is saved on the console and when it is received by the device. You may have to open the UEM agent on the device and perform a manual refresh to receive the policy. Refer to your UEM's instructions for more information. Debug mode features You can perform the following actions when Debug mode is activated: To apply any updated policies, tap Apply Latest Policies. If the policy updates aren't applied when you tap Apply Latest Policies, try again in a few minutes. It can take a short time for updated policies to be pushed from your UEM to devices. When you first open the app, it only shows the most recent pushed configuration. Tap this configuration to display the list of configuration results. You can tap Configuration results and then tap Policies received to see the policies in JSON format. To get a log of the current configurations, tap ![](./../assets/details-3-dots.png) (Details) > Export results. Successful policies are displayed in black text. Failed policies are displayed in red text. Contact Support and provide debug files In some cases, you may want to contact Support for help with a KSP issue. If you do, you need to provide the following files for investigation: ConfigurationResults_\\.txt, ReceivedPolicies_\\.txt, dumpstate log file To obtain these files for upload: 1. After enabling debug mode as described in the previous sections, open the KSP app. 2. Tap the latest configuration. 3. Tap ![](../assets/details-3-dots.png) (Details) > Export results. 4. Tap Save to save the KSP configuration results file to your Internal storage > Download folder. 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, this time tapping Export policies received, to export and save the KSP received policies file. 6. See Dumpstate logs (phone) for instructions on saving your device's dumpstate log file. Skip steps 2 - 5 in that procedure. Save the dumpstate log file soon after your issue occurs. If too much time passes, the relevant activity might no longer be contained in the log file. 7. Upload these three files to your support ticket.",

The most frequently asked questions about Knox Service Plugin As a general guideline, we recommend that you use the built-in features that your UEM console provides, and use Knox Service Plugin only for applying additional policies that are available only through Knox Service Plugin and KPE. For example, lets say you want to disable Bluetooth on a device. If your UEM console already supports disabling Bluetooth, then don't use Knox Service Plugin to disable Bluetooth. If the UEM Console supports all the Knox device restrictions you want to apply on the device, then set up the policy with the UEM console and don't use the \"device restrictions\" section of the Knox Service Plugin managed configuration. That is, keep \"Enable device restriction controls\" disabled. However, if you need to use even a single device restriction in Knox Service Plugin, then you should turn on \"Enable device restriction controls\" and then set up all the device restriction controls within that structure.",

Settings Problem Resolution Dual DAR Dual DAR is not working on my devices. You must meet the following requirements to use Dual DAR. Devices should support Dual DAR 1.1 version or higher (check by going to Device Settings &gt; About phone &gt; Software information &gt; Knox version) , Only works for fully managed device with a work profile deployments for the encryption of Work Profiles within the managed devices , You must use Knox Mobile Enrollment(KME) 1.23 or higher version to enroll the devices. See the following release notes for more information setting up Dual DAR with KME. NOTE: KSP does not initiate Dual DAR, it only helps activate a KPE Premium Dual DAR license. You configure the parameters after it is setup during enrollment by KME. Devices set up with File Based Encryption (FBE) KSP does not receive policies pushed to devices that are set up with File-based encryption (FBE) This can occur only if a device is rebooted and has not yet been unlocked. The user must unlock the mobile device with their chosen authentication in order to decrypt it. Once this is done, the KSP policies are pushed to the device. Device restrictions or advanced restrictions Native UEM policies should take precedence over KSP policies. If your UEM console natively supports a policy. You should use it instead of the KSP equivalent. This can help avoid unpredictable behavior on the device. If a KSP policy is used, the value may be overridden by your UEM in future deployment, depending on how you have set up your deployment schedule. Example: if your UEM console supports disable NFC and KSP also supports disable NFC, use the native UEM console policy. Multifactor authentication (2FA) and biometrics A conflict between multifactor authentication (2FA) and Biometric policies can cause a device to become \"Admin locked.\" When this occurs, the user can't unlock the device without admin assistance. This can occur if you turn off biometric unlock before you turn off 2FA. To avoid Admin Lock: When you activate 2FA on a device, turn on your biometric policy first (iris or fingerprint). While 2FA is enabled and running on a device, do not independently disable your biometric policy (iris or fingerprint). When you are turning off 2FA, make sure you follow this order of logic. Disable 2FA Disable biometric unlock We also strongly recommend you disable One Lock on devices where 2FA is used for Work Profile authentication. One Lock policies are supported by your native UEM console and outside the scope of KSP. NOTE: 2FA only works with Iris and Fingerprint (FP) only. Face recognition is independent and is not linked to 2FA. DeX Customization features not working DeX Customization error messages are not showing up in debug mode. Many DeX Customization features do not return errors (regardless of debug mode or normal operation). If your device has correct OS and DeX version then these will be applied, if not they will be ignored. To see the debug messages, use a device with a version of Knox that supports the DeX features you are using. Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan) Certificate based authentication with a Device Owner (DO) does not work with Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan). No resolution. Knox built-in VPN (Strong Swan) does not support certificate based authentication when deployed to a DO device. Dual SIM KSP is currently able to restrict operations on the second SIM but is unable to hide the second SIM's UI on the device. No resolution.

The device then enters an orphaned state where it remains restricted, and neither the admin nor the device user is unable to remove those restrictions. Cause Before delivering a wipe or delete command to a device, not all EMMs check the Knox Service Plugin configuration. As a result, the device can't be factory reset due to the Knox Service Plugin configuration, and is removed from the EMM console. Devices enrolled in Knox Manage don't encounter this issue, as Knox Manage checks the Knox Service Plugin configuration before proceeding with a reset. Workaround Before you wipe a device through your EMM, ensure that the Allow Factory Reset policy is set to Enable. To change this policy: 1. On the EMM console, go to the Knox Service Plugin configuration. 2. Modify the following policy: Device-wide policies > Device Restrictions > Allow Factory Reset - Enable. 3.

Ensure that the below resolution is performed by a Super Admin or a secondary admin with the appropriate permissions. To assign an active Knox Suite license key to other services in the Knox Suite bundle, register its key to any services that haven't been assigned it: 1. On the Knox Admin Portal, go to Licenses.

If you're new to Knox services, check out the recommended licensing workflow and the Knox license overview to help you find the license that works best for your enterprise. This page also provides answers to some of the following licensing questions you might have: Can any Knox services be used for free?, Which Knox services offer trial licenses?, How do commercial Knox licenses work?, Which commercial licenses can I get, and where?, Where can I manage my existing licenses? Recommended workflow 1. Generate a trial license for the service you want to use on the Knox Admin Portal. Note that when you get approved for Knox Suite, a trial license is automatically added to your account in the Knox Admin Portal. 2. Test the service by enrolling a device. If you have a Knox Suite trial license, you can also try the other services included with Knox Suite. 3. When you're ready, contact your local Knox reseller to purchase a commercial license. 4. Enter your license key in the Knox Admin Portal to start using Knox services on your full device fleet. License overview Knox licenses are used to activate Knox services on a device. Each license is associated with a license key, an alphanumeric string that acts as an identifier and allows devices to use a Knox service. When you start a trial of a Knox service, you're given a trial license key. Intended for testing and development purposes, these trial keys are valid for 3 months and support up to 30 devices. When you're ready to deploy to your full device fleet, commercial license keys can be purchased from a local reseller, with various expiry dates and license quantities based on what your enterprise needs. You can enter commercial license keys in the Knox Admin Portal. If you're looking for an all-in-one device management experience, a Knox Suite license bundles multiple Knox services. Some standalone licenses are also available for those who want to use individual services instead. If you're not sure which license works best for your enterprise yet, you can replace certain standalone licenses with a Knox Suite license anytime. The reverse also applies. The following tables provide information on the available Knox services, including the license keys they support and where to get a trial license if a service offers it. Purchase Knox commercial licenses from your local reseller. Server-based licenses Server-based licenses include both cloud and on-premises services. Enter cloud license keys on the Knox Admin Portal, and enter on-premises license keys directly on the service console.

Some Knox services are free to use. For certain services, you still need to generate a license to use them. Knox Mobile Enrollment - No license required. Knox Platform for Enterprise (Knox Service Plugin) - Requires a free, device-based Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license. You can activate this license through your EMM. Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct - Requires a free, on-premises Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct license. You can generate one on the Knox Admin Portal. Which Knox services offer trial licenses? Trial licenses can be generated for the following Knox services on the Knox Admin Portal. These licenses are intended for testing purposes, and support up to 30 devices for 3 months. After your trial ends, your devices and data remain in your account. You can continue using Knox Suite by purchasing a Knox commercial license from your local reseller and replacing your trial license. #Knox Suite trial license , Knox Mobile Enrollment (Advanced profile), Knox Manage, Knox E-FOTA , Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Remote Support, Knox Capture, Knox Authentication Manager For steps on how to generate a Knox Suite trial license key, refer to the Knox Admin Portal documentation. #Other Knox service trial licenses , Knox Guard, Knox Configure How do commercial Knox licenses work? A commercial Knox license lets you use Knox services across your entire device fleet, and can be obtained through your local Knox reseller. If you don't have a reseller yet, see the Knox reseller directory to find one near you. When you purchase a license from a reseller, you can decide how many seats the license has, which equates to the number of devices you want to activate concurrently on the service. The reseller then gives you a license key, which you can enter on the Knox Admin Portal to register the license. Once a license is assigned to a device, the service you're enrolling in consumes a seat on the license. For example, if your reseller provided you with a 200-seat Knox Configure license, you can have a maximum of 200 devices enrolled in Knox Configure. Each license has an expiry date, after which the license can't be used with Knox services anymore. The exception to this rule is staggered license keys, which allow you to use the service even after the license expiration date, until the service period ends. To add more seats to your license or renew an existing license, contact your Knox reseller. #Staggered licenses Some services, like Knox Configure, Knox Guard, and Samsung Care+ for Business, offer staggered licenses, which allows devices to use a service even after the license expires. These licenses have an activation period, which dictates when you can enroll new devices. Once a device is enrolled, its service period starts, which is how long the device can use a service for. The service period typically remains active after the activation period ends and the license expires. The activation period and service period can differ by service. However, if you purchase more seats on the license before the activation period ends, you can continue to enroll devices for a year past the new purchase date. Let's say you purchased 100 seats on a license in January 2023, which means you can enroll 100 devices until January 2024. If you purchase an extra 100 seats in August 2023, you're now able to enroll all 200 devices with that license until August 2024. Which commercial licenses can I get, and where? The following table lists each Knox service, its license type, and the licenses it supports. Each service name is also linked to its respective documentation, where you can get license information specific to that service.

If your Knox Platform for Enterprise license is about to expire within the next 90 days, make sure to renew the license for another two years. Otherwise, your existing devices will be impacted.

Cross-region support A Samsung Knox account registered in the Americas can't be used to manage Global devices, and the other way around. IT admins who manage devices in both the Americas and Global regions must create two Samsung Knox accounts. We recommend using subaddressing or plus addressing when creating two different Samsung Knox accounts. During account creation, append +us or +eu to your email username to easily manage both regional accounts with a single email address. For example, if your work email is username@example.com, you can use username+us@example.com and username+eu@example.com when signing up for your US and EU accounts respectively.",

            "content": "Feature Summary. For those wanting a quick reference to the security, manageability, and advanced VPN\"features offered by Samsung Knox devices, review the summary below. For details about how Samsung Knox differentiates compared to other OEM devices, speak with your Samsung account manager or contact us if you do not have one. Feature Summary Security Hardware-Backed Keystore This feature is a hardware-dependent claim. All Samsung Knox devices have keystores backed by hardware protections. Secure Lockdown on Tampering Upon detecting critical security compromises, the system locks down sensitive areas, preventing unauthorized enterprise data access and leakage. When there is evidence of device tampering, Samsung prevents users from accessing the data in a work profile or on a fully managed device. To unlock the device again, one needs to factory reset the device, which wipes out the data inside. Remote Device Health Get visibility into which devices have security issues like unauthorized firmware, allowing you to take action right away. Knox checks the record of IMEI tampering and whether the warranty bit is blown. Knox Vault An isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key, biometric data, and blockchain credentials. It runs security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Keystore Support of eSE\"& Other High-Security Storage Numerous services require credentials for access. They include Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. In order to safely store sensitive credentials, developers need to write new credential storage code for any new storage hardware. Knox provides a plug-and-play framework for credential management across a variety of hardware, eliminating the need to develop in-house credential management implementation logic. Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) SDP keeps data encrypted while a work profile or fully managed device is locked, even during runtime when other solutions decrypt data. Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP) Drastically limits possible attacks on Samsung devices with best-in-class kernel attack prevention features: Kernel Text Protection (KTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate Kernel text (code and RO data). Page Table Protection (PTP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel and user page table. Kernel Data Protection (KDP): Protects against any attempt to forge or manipulate the Kernel namespace/credential/security ID/double map including kernel code, kernel data, and kernel control flow protections. Control Flow Protection (CFP): Prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that re-use existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. DualDAR Encryption With a single instance of encryption, potential flaws in the implementation can result in a single point of failure. KPE DualDAR provides two independent layers of encryption to achieve an even higher level of reliability by enabling redundancies in protecting Data-At-Rest. You can further strengthen data encryption by using a third-party cryptographic module to customize encryption. This dual encryption is required for classified deployments. Note that there is an additional license fee to use DualDAR. ML Model Protection Machine Learning and Neural models come with unique security challenges that are difficult to address without support from the mobile operating system platform. Knox ML Model Protection leverages the Knox platform to provide developers with the secure encryption, operation, and access control of ML models. Enforced Two-Factor Authentication Enables IT admins to force end-user two-factor authentication for logging in to a work profile or fully managed device. Two-factor authentication is done through a combination of biometrics (fingerprint and iris) and more traditional means (password, PIN, pattern). Government-Grade Common Criteria Mode Simplifies configuring devices into a compliant state for Common Criteria (national security) deployments. Separated Apps For enterprises that need full control over a corporate-owned device, while still enabling authorized third-party business apps, Samsung exclusively offers Separated Apps to isolate third-party apps in a sandboxed folder. App Isolation Groups (SEAMS) Unlike classic app containers with a GUI, you can manage \"invisible\" app isolation groups to protect a set of apps from any other set. Up to 300 groupings are possible. Secure Certificate Enrollment Agents (SCEP, CMP, CMC_EST protocols) Samsung provides a free set of certificate enrollment agents that follow the latest security protocols. There is no reason to enroll certificates insecurely, or implement your own protocols. Manageability Audit Log Provides comprehensive and detailed device audit logs, recording numerous extra types of events in the areas of system security, authentication, app management, data protection, network connectivity, and peripheral control. Satisfies government requirements for security audit trails. Device Software Updates Knox E-FOTA running on top of KPE enables IT to deploy a particular firmware version that is not necessarily the latest version. These selective firmware updates provide a stable environment for business apps and services. KPE allows firmware updates under certain conditions such as a particular time of the day, network (Wi-Fi or mobile), or battery power status. These features help optimize productivity and ensure a successful upgrade. Remote Control KPE enables IT\"to remotely control devices, by injecting finger, keyboard, and mouse events. This is in addition to remotely viewing devices. Peripheral Framework In addition to managing mobile devices, you can use the Samsung Knox SDK to manage peripherals like barcode readers that are connected to or integrated with devices. Through a peripheral framework, partners can easily automate the setup, monitoring, diagnostics, and control of different peripheral models. Customization Allows IT to customize various aspects of the device software and UI. In addition to more common capabilities, KPE provides these additional abilities: Change the bootup logo Change power behavior such as auto power on/off Change homescreen layout Remap hardware key such as PTT and Emergency Configure Settings at a deep granularity Extend battery life by allowing charging only up to 80% Granular Roaming Controls IT\"can control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming, which often incurs high call, text, and data rates. AE only allows IT admins to disable mobile data &mdash; it can't block calls or app update downloads while allowing other mobile data use. KPE Premium also enables separate roaming controls for each APN. Admin Device Lock Knox allows IT admins to remotely lock a device in a way that a user cannot unlock at all. In addition, Knox allows controlling the personal space and work profile separately. For example, the personal space can be open while the work profile is locked. Data Sharing Policy KPE provides data sync of Contacts, Calendar, and Notifications. Also, KPE provides a unified Calendar with both personal and work events. Firewall Management Industry-exclusive ability to set on-device firewall rules. KPE\"can also notify IT when employees attempt to visit blocked domains. Granular Device Policies Meet compliance or other deployment requirements with policies not supported on AE for SMS/MMS disclaimers, RCS/SMS/MMS logging, call restrictions, read and write restrictions on SD cards, granular Bluetooth profile restrictions, and even manage DeX deployment settings. Advanced Workspace Configuration Enables strict policy enforcement for Bluetooth, SD Card, USB, and other technologies inside the work profile, while allowing full use outside the work profile. Unlock using Active Directory Credentials No need to make employees remember separate credentials for Windows laptops and mobile devices. Device users can use their existing Active Directory credentials to unlock their devices. Split Billing (Dual APNs) Enables enterprises to pay only for the data usage of their approved business apps. Employees are responsible for fees for personal data usage. Network Analytics Allows IT to deploy network threat detection solutions without granting such tools complete access to all network traffic. For details about the insights provided, see Network Platform Analytics. VPN VPN Granularity: Per-App, Per-Container, or Whole Device KPE provides the most granular VPN controls. In addition to configuring a VPN for an app, work profile, or fully managed device, KPE can configure a single VPN for the entire device - that is, work profile as well as fully managed device. Non-bypassable VPN KPE has strict controls that block any traffic from bypassing a configured VPN, even in edge cases where a device is rebooting, a VPN client crashes, an app accesses the physical interface directly, or an app using a VPN is deleted and re-installed. On-Demand VPN KPE can activate a VPN only when a target app is launched. Such a feature allows customers to save on service fees from unused VPNs. HTTP Proxy over VPN KPE has a wide range of network protocols that can use HTTP Proxy. No auth, basic auth, NTLM v2 auth Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported VPN Chaining Allows the use of two VPN tunnels to double-encrypt traffic, enhance anonymity, and prevent a single security bug in a VPN layer from compromising network encryption.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "DualDAR Encryption. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern for security conscious enterprises. The Samsung Knox Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) already addresses this issue, by decrypting data only after user authentication, providing per-file and per-data decryption keys, offering per-app password checks, and meeting MDFPP requirements for US government and military use. Knox DualDAR adds two separate layers of encryption, further meeting the requirements of classified deployments. Knox DualDAR secures all Work profile data on devices with two distinct levels of encryption. The solution also protects data by restricting apps from writing or saving data to the unencrypted space on the device. As the name implies, Knox DualDAR is based on two layers of data encryption. To fully understand how DualDAR works, we need to examine how the two layers of encryption within DualDAR work. The DualDAR solution provides the following two separate layers of encryption and key generation. All data placed inside the Work profile is dually encrypted by both layers. Currently, DualDAR only secures data placed inside the designated Work profile. Outer layer - The outer layer of the DualDAR solution is built on top of Android's FBE and enhanced by Samsung to meet MDFPP requirements. This layer is implemented through the SoC dedicated to flash storage encryption. In this context, the SoC could be Qualcomm Integrated Crypto Engine (ICE) or Exynos Flash Memory Protector (FMP). Data encryption at this layer is AES 256 XTS and file encryption keys are encrypted using AES-GCM 256. Inner layer - The inner layer of encryption is based on a framework that allows an independent third party to install a separate cryptographic module. If no third party module is installed, an separate inner layer of encryption is secured by a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module included with the Samsung Knox framework. DualDAR is supported on the Galaxy S10, N10, S20, and subsequent flagship models, and is compatible with Android FBE. How DualDAR encryption works DualDAR's inner and outer security layers are independent and protect all information stored in the Work profile when the device is in a powered off or unauthenticated state. Samsung Knox DualDAR leverages Android File Based Encryption (FBE) architecture. On a FBE-enabled device, every device has the following two storage locations available to an app. Credential Encrypted (CE) storage - Default storage location and only available after a user has unlocked the device. Device Encrypted (DE) storage - Storage location available both during Direct Boot mode and after the user has unlocked the device. From an app point of view, the DualDAR Work profile functions as CE storage. The Knox framework prevents apps from writing data to non-DualDAR protected DE storage. In some cases an app is aware of both CE and DE storage, and needs to write unclassified content to DE storage. In such cases, IT admins can allow that app to write to DE storage. This strict allowlist process ensures that no app can write sensitive or classified content to DE storage without explicit IT admin approval. When the Work container is configured for DualDAR, the secured data is available as follows. 1. On a device that supports and is configured for DualDAR, access to app data inside the container is only available when the container is unlocked, that is when the user is actively using the container. 2. When the container - or device as a whole - is locked, the container encryption keys are evicted from memory. 3. In a data lock state, the Samsung device remains powered on but the user is locked out of both the Work Container and device. All sensitive data is protected in Credential Encrypted (CE) storage within the Work profile. CE storage is not available until the user provides both their device and Work profile credentials. Unique advantages of Knox DualDAR DualDAR encryption has the following significant advantages over traditional single layer encryption methods. Mitigate risks of implementation flaws - DualDAR reduces the likelihood of unauthorized data access by mitigating the risks that arise from vulnerabilities in a single encryption layer. While one of the many methods available for unauthorized data access may crack through a single layer of encryption, the chances are very low that such vulnerabilities are available on both layers of encryption. Mitigate risks of password configuration flaws - Both layers of encryption on a DualDAR configured device use separate and distinct authentication methods to allow access. This separation of authentication methods reduces the likelihood that a single misplaced or misconfigured password is exploited on both layers of data encryption at the same time. Two layers of encryption and two methods of authentication ensure that encrypted data remains protected even in the event of breach on one layer. Provide access using strict security evaluation criteria - DualDAR meets the standards laid out in the FIPS 140 certification requirements. Both the inner and outer layers use FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules. GCM is used to encrypt the key while data is encrypted using XTS or CBC. Ease of deployment - DualDAR leverages the in-built Android FBE framework and builds additional layers of security on top of this framework. This solution is available on devices that use a Work container in PO mode as well as fully managed devices that include a PO mode. For more information on configuring this solution for your supported device, see the DualDAR architecture page. Customize the second layer of encryption - DualDAR allows IT admins to implement third party encryption solutions at the inner layer of encryption. This freedom of implementation means IT admins can use and configure any third party cryptographic modules, including solutions that meet FIPS 140 certification criteria. Flexible deployment methods - IT admins can implement and configure DualDAR on all kinds of devices, including BYOD and company-issued devices. Whether the device uses a Work container in PO mode or is a fully managed device that includes a\"PO mode, DualDAR is compatible with both models. This flexibility means IT admins can use this superior data security solution on a wide variety of devices within their enterprise.

Mobile apps have changed the way we work by providing new channels of communication, innovating customer engagement, and empowering organizations with critical data in real-time. Samsung Knox devices include a set of productivity apps for both personal and business use. Business-critical apps include Samsung Email, Internet browser, Calendar, and Contacts. Enterprise IT\"admins can secure these apps within the Work profile, along with other apps used by the enterprise. The Knox Platform secures enterprise apps and protects confidential app data through these methods: App installations and updates - Apps are pre-installed within the mobile device's secure Work profile and users can update these apps independent of firmware updates through Google Play. App isolation - \"Apps are sandboxed within the Work profile, which uses SE for Android to prevent personal apps from interfering with the business apps that are in the Work profile. App permissions - \"Knox provides App Permission Monitoring to help users prevent malware from using powerful permissions to gain unauthorized access to the device and Work profile. Data At Rest - Through\"Knox's Sensitive Data Protection (SDP), the files and data used by an app can remain encrypted until device users authenticate at device unlock or Work profile login. Individual apps can further deploy an app-specific password as another line of defense. Data In Transit - App data sent through the public Internet can be secured using Knox's advanced VPN features. DeX integration - Not only are all Samsung native apps optimized to work within DeX, enterprises can secure apps while they're displayed in DeX. Samsung Email The Samsung Email app is uniquely designed for customers requiring the secure synchronization of their mobile device's Email calendar, tasks, and memo functions.

            "content": "Common Criteria Mode. Knox supports advanced device configurations tailored to the defense industry. A single Knox setting can apply many of the settings needed to put the device into a compliant state. This setting, called Common Criteria Mode or CC Mode, helps simplify the task of correctly configuring a device for deployments that must meet defense-grade security requirements. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, commonly referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally-recognized standard for defining security objectives of information technology products and for evaluating vendor compliance with these objectives. A number of Governments use Common Criteria as the basis for their own certification schemes. Select Samsung Galaxy devices with the Knox Platform embedded received Common Criteria (CC) certification. The current CC certification targets the new Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which addresses the security requirements of mobile devices for use in enterprise. Samsung Knox is approved by the United States Government as the first NIAP-validated consumer mobile devices to handle the full range of classified information. An IT\"admin can enable the device to be placed into the Common Criteria configuration. When enabled, the device: Blocks bootloader download mode, the manual method for software updates, Mandates additional key zeroization on key deletion, Prevents non-authenticated Bluetooth connections, Requires that FOTA updates have a 2048-bit RSA-PSS signature, Uses many other security settings While other optional configuration steps are still recommended on top of Common Criteria Mode, the value is clear: simplifying the correct configuration of endpoints for high-security deployments saves time and prevents mistakes that can lead to misconfigurations and added security risks.

            "content": "Client Certificate Manager (CCM). Samsung builds upon the Android Keystore by providing a tamper-proof, detection-based lock-down of cryptographic keys and certificates. This solution supports a variety of high-security use cases important to enterprises, as described in the following sections. Granular certificate and key access control The Knox Platform supports an app allowlist for certificates, allowing the certificate installer to define which apps are allowed to perform cryptographic operations based on their certificates. This certificate allowlist process offers better control and flexibility than simply allowing app-only or device-wide access rights to certificates. #Silent installation Knox 3.2.1 allows IT\"admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user. Signing with device-specific certificates A special certificate called the Device Default Certificate (DDC) resides within each device. What makes this certificate special is that it is tied to that device's hardware, is signed by the Device Root Key (DRK), and can never leave the device. Any objects signed by the same DDC are guaranteed to have come from the same Samsung device. There is no way to spoof the identity of a device by reusing a DDC and its key pair on a different device. Device integrity assurance Objects signed with this certificate were signed while the device was in good health, meaning when the device was uncompromised. If a device fails its integrity checks - by failing the signature check of the kernel or OS or disabling SE for Android - the following happens: A tamper fuse is set; _and_, The DDC is rendered permanently unusable. This lockdown helps attest to the health of the device where the data was signed. After all, you can't trust a signature if the device doing the signing is compromised. The Knox Platform provides a CSR agent that benefits from this device health attestation claim. A CSR produced and signed by the CSR agent carries implicit device health security claims. Keystore integration with other features A keystore is only as useful as the use cases it supports. In addition to manual cryptographic actions - such as sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt - the Knox Platform provides built-in logic to support sensitive certificate-based actions enterprises often need to secure their solutions such as the following: Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - The ability to complete CSRs with a trusted agent, tied to the Knox Platform's hardware-based Root of Trust, simplifies the secure handling of mobile endpoint requests for digital identity certificates. Instead of sending key pairs and certificates from servers, keys can instead be securely generated on-device and bound to hardware. The public certificate is then included in an appropriate CSR request. Using the CSR agent to validate CSR contents and sign the request avoids trusting sensitive actions to third-party code running in less trusted areas of the device. Certificate Enrollment Protocols (CEPs) - Similar to CSR, CEP\"provides built-in agents for logic that enterprises rely on, saving time and enhancing security claims. For more information, see Certificate Enrollment Protocols. In addition to the DDC, you can generate or install your own certificate and key pairs and specify they are accessible only if the device is in good health. This additional process locks down the keystore in the event of a device integrity failure.",

            "title": "Universal Credential Management (UCM)",
            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Universal Credential Management (UCM). Digital credentials are critical mobile security building blocks, leveraging trusted authorities to validate identity and secure private channels across public deployments. Your mobile device credentials provide seamless access to secured Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and websites. Credentials include certificates providing identity and private keys to decrypt sensitive data. These credentials must be securely stored to prevent malicious parties from exploiting your identity and accessing confidential data. Universal Credential Management works only on Qualcomm and Exynos chip devices. Secure elements While Android apps are able to store digital credentials securely on Samsung Android devices using the hardware-backed Keystore, some use cases require the user credentials and secrets stored in a secure element, which can come in form factors such as the following: Embedded Secure Element (eSE) - Supports the storing and accessing of credentials, allowing secure storage on the device without additional hardware. Micro SD card, Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), Smart card - Smart cards' resiliency makes them ideal for storing credentials if the threat model calls for trust to be shifted outside the device. The Samsung eSE is not available with the following countries and carriers: USA-Verizon, Korea-All, Japan-All, Canada-Telus. Certain customers, especially in government and related industries, have internal regulations requiring the use of approved secure elements for storing credentials and secrets. The secure element is provisioned with an applet that provides certain cryptographic functions. Use cases The UCM framework implements a service layer that allows vendors to make their solution available to specialized apps on the device including: Device lock (keyguard) - The user inserts a PIN to authenticate themselves to the applet running in the secure element. If the PIN authentication is successful, the UCM framework retrieves a password from credential storage, which is used as the device password to unlock the device. Data at Rest (DAR) encryption - The applet provides another layer of protection for the device encryption keys. UCM allows for the device encryption key to be wrapped by the applet. The wrapped device encryption is unwrapped when the user provides the correct PIN on device boot. UCM framework The Universal Credential Management (UCM) framework enables Android apps to access all credential storage devices through the same standard programming interface - the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) API via either: a specific provider to carry out supported crypto operations, the Android Keychain API for key and certificate operations The vendor providing the secure element solution (including the applet) implements a UCM plugin, which registers their solution as a Keystore provider. Apps can simply refer to the vendor's provider when calling Keystore API. A significant benefit of the UCM framework is that it uniquely enables storage vendors to develop a plugin that provides access to their storage space and cryptographic operations, without forcing app developers to change their code or forcing IT admins or end users to update their apps. The plugin essentially acts as the link between the UCM framework and a specific storage device. The UCM framework consolidates and standardizes credential services to provide a streamlined interface for: EMM or ISV apps - These apps configure, provision, and consume credentials, managing credential storage access permissions, and activating advanced UCM permissions. The apps can enforce the installation, removal, or per-app access control of a credential. Storage provider plugin - These apps are provided by storage vendors to link the UCM framework to their storage solution, to manage stored credentials. Secure storage - This feature currently includes the Samsung eSE and Smart Card readers described in Secure elements section. You can easily support other storage options through additional vendor plugins. The Knox SDK provides credential storage vendors a set of UCM APIs to make current and future storage options available on Samsung devices, hiding the implementation details of their solution so that mobile app developers can transparently access stored credentials through standard APIs, such as the Android Keychain. Similarly, developers can use the Java Cryptography Extension APIs to offload cryptographic operations to a capable Smart Card. This abstraction, made possible by the UCM framework, eliminates the need for complex vendor-specific code within mobile apps, meaning enterprise customers have a wide range of existing apps available to them and can easily develop in-house apps without worrying about the underlying storage implementation. UCM allowlist The UCM framework uses two types of allowlists, which uniquely manage access controls for credential storage and offer fully customizable access permissions: App allowlist - Enforces which apps can access each secure storage type. Every secure storage device maps to its respective UCM plugin, that a secure storage solution provider creates and maintains. Credential allowlist - Enforces each app's access to credentials, providing app-specific access permissions. By enforcing access control, admins can prevent credential usage by malicious or untrusted apps.",

            "content": "App Security. Device users typically want their personal and work apps on the same device. This requirement presents a challenge for enterprises, which need to ensure that they fully protect their confidential corporate assets _and_ don't run into any liability issues by accidentally interfering with a user's personal privacy. With Android 11, Google continues to protect user privacy, extending these protections to company-owned devices. Specifically, Google has replaced the device management mode called fully managed device with a work profile work profile on company-owned device. Here is a summary of different device management modes and their use cases: Corporate Owned Business Only (COBO) Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and doesn't allow personal apps on the device. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device and can't compromise corporate assets by allowing users to install their own apps. Fully managed device with a work profile (FMDWP) Deprecated in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, allows users to install personal apps, and secures work apps in a work profile. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as device owner which has control over the entire device, and a second UEM app to serve as profile owner which has control over the work profile. Use case: Enterprises used this model to give users freedom over the apps they installed, were able to fully view and manage personal as well as work apps. Separated Apps Exclusive to Samsung Knox devices, and set up only through the Knox Service Plugin (KSP). Summary: An enterprise owns the device, and allows users to install authorized third-party business apps (for example, airline, hotel, or ride-sharing apps) in a securely separated folder. Control scope: Through a UEM app, the enterprise serves as the device owner which has full control over the entire device. Through KSP, the enterprise can set up a Separated Apps folder and identify the apps allowed to be installed inside the folder. Use case: Enterprises use this model if they need strict control over the entire device, but want to enable staff productivity using a separate, lightly managed app folder. For more detail about using this mode, see Separated Apps. Work profile on company-owned device (WP-C) New in Android 11. Summary: An enterprise owns the device, secures work apps in a work profile, and allows users to install personal apps. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over the work profile. If the enterprise deploys the work profile from the setup wizard using the provisioning tools added in Android 10<, the device is recognized as company-owned and a wider range of asset management and device security policies is made available than that granted to personally-owned devices. Enterprises can still apply policies at the device level as long as they don't infringe on personal privacy; for details, see Android policies in the personal side and Knox policies in the personal side Use case: Enterprises use this model if they want to give users freedom over the apps they use on company devices without infringing on their user privacy. For more detail about using this mode, see Google's EMM migration guidelines\" target=\"_blank (which requires a partner login) or Work profile on company owned devices. #Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) , Summary: An employee owns the device, and installs work apps on their device to enable productivity. Control scope: The enterprise uses one UEM app to serve as profile owner with control over work apps in the work profile. Use case: Smaller enterprises might use this model to save on the capital costs associated with buying devices. Google deprecated the legacy device admin (DA) management mode in Android 10. By November 2, 2020, Google requires app updates to target API level 29 or Android 10. From this date onwards, app updates start throwing exceptions if they call the four deprecated DA policies. For more info, see Device admin deprecation. Knox Workspace containers were deprecated with Knox 3.4.1 on Android 10, which debuted with the Note 10. However, older devices like the S10 that are upgraded to Knox 3.4.1 or higher still support the Knox Workspace containers until EOL. To take advantage of all the latest Android Enterprise and Knox features, we strongly recommend that you use work profiles instead of Knox Workspace containers. Knox-enhanced work profiles The Android Enterprise work profile provides enterprises with a solution to securely isolate work apps and data on one device. The Knox Platform for Enterprise provides more granular management policies for work profiles on Samsung devices. #Data transfer With the isolation of work and personal data, a device user has access to two separate spaces. To increase productivity in certain situations, it is often necessary to share data between spaces. For example, while using a phone app in the personal space, it may be necessary to call a work contact saved in the secure work space. With the Work profile, IT admins have granular management policies to manage the import and export of data to and from the Work profile. This data can include apps, files, clipboard data, call logs, contacts, calendar events, bookmarks, notifications, shortcuts, and SMS. #Container-only control For liability and productivity purposes, IT admins can't apply effective policies on a device with both personal and work data. The provides IT admins the ability to configure and control critical functionality for the container only. An IT admin can enable or disable the following exclusively for the container: Bluetooth, NFC, USB access, External storage #Container configuration With the isolation of work and personal data, the device user has access to two separate spaces. This dual access presents some challenges to quickly identifying and accessing work data. To enhance usability, the Work profile provides an IT admin the ability to add work shortcuts to personal spaces so device users can quickly access work data. The Work profile also provides an IT admin with the ability to set custom resources like work badges on app icons, helping users quickly identify company work apps. #Password policy An IT admin must ensure only authorized people have access to work data inside a container. The Work profile supports advanced authentication mechanisms to meet all enterprise needs. An IT admin can enforce and configure: Complex passwords or code schemes, Two-factor authentication, Active Directory authentication Additionally, an IT admin can lock the container to restrict access. This restriction is necessary when a device is out of compliance, lost, or stolen.",

            "content": "Device Health Attestation. Mobile apps can be compromised if unauthorized actors are able to run them on untrustworthy hardware or firmware. Such unauthorized actors might include: a malicious user deliberately accessing a device they're not authorized to, for example, while the user is away, a bad actor who manipulates the device, or its firmware in transit Such an actor can easily gain full control over the device firmware, files, UI, and apps. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these scenarios to: install apps, steal passwords, hijack identities Enterprises with Bring Your Own Device programs are especially at risk, as employees may potentially use compromised Android devices in the workplace. Risks range from: the undetected exposure of confidential enterprise assets, wider more insidious attacks on other enterprise resources and infrastructure Knox Attestation provides a fail-safe way to detect if a device or its firmware is compromised, before allowing device users to use it in the workplace. Reliable detection of compromised devices Malware can potentially intercept and forge the results of a device health check, making a compromised device seem secure. Knox Attestation guards against this risk as follows: 1. The Knox platform leverages its hardware-backed trusted environment to reliably detect and report compromised devices. Knox Attestation ensures the integrity of devices during deployment, bootup, and operation using the following: Root of Trust - Starts in our factories, when devices are manufactured, with device-unique hardware keys providing a foundation of trust. Trusted Boot - Detects unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise devices using bootloader measurements recorded in secure TrustZone memory. Knox Vault - Stores sensitive data such as the Samsung Attestation Key in tamper-proof storage that resists both hardware and software attacks. 2. Samsung incorporates a Device-Unique Hardware Key in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. This key binds the device health attestation data to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. 3. Knox Attestation signs device health data to prove that it originated from the TrustZone Secure World on a Samsung Knox device. Each device uses a Samsung Attestation Key. When the device is manufactured, a unique RSA private/public key pair is generated. The public key is also signed by a special Samsung Root Key to generate a X.509 certificate. Both the Samsung Attestation Key and its certificate are secured in the device's TrustZone. 4. In case a device is already compromised when a health check is performed, the final test on device health is performed by a Samsung attestation server. To protect data-in-transit, Knox Attestation uses TLS encryption. 5. To validate device health data, the Samsung attestation server verifies the Samsung Attestation Key certificate, Attestation Key certificate, and signatures to ensure the integrity of the attestation result. 6. To protect from man-in-the-middle replay attacks, which replay the attestation result collected on a healthy device or the same device before it was compromised, the server verifies the random nonce value generated for each requested health check. Highly secure or firewalled operations that don't want to access the web-based Samsung Attestation server can install an Attestation Validator tool onto a local server to parse the Attestation Result and keep device verdicts within the firewall. How Knox Attestation works Partners such as EMM vendors or ISVs use our Knox APIs to deploy attestation checks. They can enable device checks manually by an admin using a web console or automatically by a regularly scheduled process. 1. The web server that initiated the check does the following: requests a nonce from the Samsung Attestation server. A nonce is a random number used in cryptographic communication to time-bound and identify each attestation result. instructs the device to begin a check, passing the nonce as a check identifier. 2. The Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) in Secure World gathers this data: the requesting app's package name, version code, and developer key , signed info about the device's current state and expected environment , hardware fuse readings indicating if untrusted firmware was ever loaded onto the device 3. The TA compiles this information into an Attestation Result and signs it with a key that can be verified using the Samsung Root Certificate. 4. The device communicates with the Samsung Attestation Server using TLS encryption to protect data-in-transit. 5. The Samsung Attestation Server validates the Attestation Result's signature to ensure that it was generated on Samsung hardware and by Samsung's TA. 6. The Samsung Attestation Server analyzes the Attestation Result to determine if the returned nonce matches the one sent out and whether the data within it can be trusted. Managing compromised devices On detecting a compromised device, the Knox platform fuses a one-time programmable Warranty bit that signifies whether or not the device has ever booted into an unapproved state. Once this bit is fused, the work profile no longer operates, preventing access to the secured enterprise apps and data. The original requestor of the device check can take further action, for example, , Report the verdict to the device user. Immediately prevent the device from accessing other enterprise systems. Uninstall any enterprise apps or assets already on the device. Unique advantages of Knox Attestation Knox Attestation provides these key differentiators: Prevention of replay attacks - Health measurements guaranteed per request through a nonce, a unique number randomly generated by the Samsung Attestation Server. Prevention of device ID falsification - Knox Attestation forms a chain of trust using the Samsung Root Key, Samsung Attestation Key, and Attestation Key. It signs attestation results using the Attestation Key, and appends the Attestation Key certificate and Samsung Attestation Key certificate. Detection of systemless rooting - Rooting methods like Magisk store system file modifications in the boot partition, which can go undetected by tamper detection methods other than Knox Attestation. Correlation of results per device - Health results that easily map to device identifiers like an IMEI. Unlike other solutions on the market, Knox Attestation enables IT admins to determine which attestation result correlates with which device, without having to painstakingly map IDs manually. With competitor solutions, results are returned for separate devices, but IT admins can't differentiate between devices, and consequently the results are not actionable. Knox Attestation returns a single device ID and enables IT admins to prevent or contain issues promptly. Historical tamper record - Knox Attestation guarantees not only the current health of the device, but also a record of whether the device ever ran a non-approved configuration in the past, through the Knox Warranty Fuse. NOTE: The current release of Knox Attestation was enhanced with Knox version 3.4 and higher. Prior to that, Knox Attestation did not support the enhanced Samsung Attestation Key, detection of device ID falsification, or data-in-transit protection using TLS encryption (SSL encryption was used).",

            "content": "Knox Vault. Samsung's Knox Vault is an evolution of the hardware-based security that Samsung has been building within Galaxy smartphones for years. Knox Vault extends upon the protection offered by our TrustZone, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) pioneered by Samsung to protect sensitive data such as passwords, biometrics, and cryptographic keys. Whereas the TrustZone runs a different OS alongside Android on the primary application processor, Knox Vault operates completely independently from the primary processor running the Android OS. As a core component of the Knox security platform, Knox Vault is an isolated, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor and memory, as well as an interface to dedicated, non-volatile secure storage. Knox Vault can: Store sensitive data such as hardware-backed Android Keystore keys, the Samsung Attestation Key (SAK), biometric data, and blockchain credentials. Run security-critical code that authenticates users with increasing timeouts between failures and controls access to keys depending on authentication. Knox Vault is integrated into Samsung devices starting from the Galaxy S21, and is comprised of components that are Common Criteria evaluated to the requirements in BSI PP0084 at EAL4+ or higher. These components are tested by an independent lab against a wide array of hardware attacks and through a review of their software and firmware. #Protection from attacks Knox Vault provides strong security guarantees against both software and hardware attacks. Because Knox Vault is independent from the primary processor that runs Android, code running on the Knox Vault Processor is resistant to attacks that exploit shared resources, such as software side-channel attacks that can compromise other software executing on the same processor. This separation means Knox Vault protects sensitive data even if the primary processor itself is completely compromised. In addition to being resistant to software attacks, Knox Vault is also designed to be tamper-proof to thwart hardware attacks, which require that an attacker have physical possession of a device to extract secrets. Knox Vault is resistant to hardware attacks such as the following: Physical probing to disclose data, Physical manipulation of the circuitry to deactivate security mechanisms, Forced information leakage, Hardware side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis to disclose data, Fault injection to bypass security mechanisms. For details about these attack types, see Protection from Hardware Attacks. Knox Vault features Among the many capabilities of Knox Vault, the following are key to the overall security of protected devices. #Weaver Weaver is used for secure password authentication to Android. Running on the Knox Vault Processor, Weaver's data and secrets (passwords) are stored encrypted in the secure Knox Vault Storage. When Weaver receives the secret data to be stored, it also receives a key, and this key must be provided to read the secret data again from Weaver. To prevent brute-force attempts to extract secrets, Weaver uses a binary exponential back-off algorithm. When attempting to read a secret, if the proper key is not provided, Weaver declines read operations for a time period decided by the back-off algorithm. A non-bypassable secure timer is used to track these time periods. #Credential storage This feature stores data encrypted by the Knox Vault Processor in the Knox Vault Storage, using a secure channel to protect data transfered between the Knox Vault Processor and the Knox Vault Storage. The following data is stored in the Knox Vault Storage: Cryptographic keys to protect biometric data, Blockchain keystore credentials, Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) All data in Credential Storage is encrypted using a Knox Vault-unique key. This prevents the data from being decrypted in other devices. #Samsung Attestation Key Samsung Knox Attestation is a Knox platform feature that is designed to detect if a device or its keys are compromised, and can be used to prevent access to security-sensitive Samsung systems like Knox services, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Pass. Each device has a unique, asymmetric, elliptic-curve private Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) that is stored in Knox Vault. The key generation processes ensure the keys are unique, based on strong random number generation. #StrongBox Keymaster support The StrongBox Keymaster is a key management module supporting various cryptographic algorithms that can be used by applications to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations with them. The Android framework provides a KeyStore API for applications to use the StrongBox Keymaster. All keys generated by the StrongBox Keymaster or imported into it are encrypted with the unique key of Knox Vault. Thus, these keys cannot be decrypted outside of the StrongBox Keymaster running on the Knox Vault Processor. Knox Vault architecture Knox Vault is made up of the following: Knox Vault Subsystem: implemented as part of the SoC, Knox Vault Storage: an integrated circuit physically outside the SoC Through a secure interface, the Knox Vault Subsystem communicates with the Knox Vault Storage. #Knox Vault Subsystem The Knox Vault Subsystem is designed to operate separately from other SoC components. It has its own secure processing environment consisting of the Knox Vault Processor, SRAM, and ROM. It also provides enhanced security and data protection against various hardware-based attacks, by monitoring the hardware status and its environment using a series of security sensors or detectors including: High and Low Temperature detectors, High and Low Supply Voltage detectors, Supply Voltage Glitch detecto, Laser detecto The Knox Vault Subsystem also includes a dedicated random number generator, and its own Crypto Engine. The Knox Vault Processor can access system DRAM though the External Memory Manager. ##Knox Vault Processor The Knox Vault Processor provides the main computing power for Knox Vault. To provide the strongest isolation, the Knox Vault Processor is separated from the primary processor on the SoC. This separation helps prevent side-channel attacks that depend on malicious software sharing the same execution core as the target software under attack. By executing the instructions and managing data on SRAM, the Knox Vault Processor also guarantees a physically isolated execution environment. The Knox Vault Subsystem ROM where the secure boot loader code is located is also separated and protected by the hardware protection mechanisms. When the Knox Vault Processor starts, the ROM code is loaded to SRAM. While the ROM code loads the Knox Vault Processor firmware, with the help of the modules running on the SOC main processor, the software stack of Knox Vault Processor has its own secure boot chain. ##Hardware monitor The Hardware Monitor checks for abnormal hardware status from the security sensors and detectors. The monitoring and detection cannot be affected or bypassed by any application running on Knox Vault Processor. ##Crypto engine A hardware cryptographic module provides the following cryptographic functions: AES encryption/decryption, DRBG random number generation, SHA hashing, HMAC keyed-hashing for message authentication code, RSA and ECC key generation and services ##Knox Vault unique key The Knox Vault unique key is written into one-time-programmable fuses. This unique key is used for protecting keys imported into or generated in the Knox Vault Subsystem. Thus, a key generated in Knox Vault on one device cannot be used outside of that device. ##External memory manager The Knox Vault Subsystem can read or write to external memory using the External Memory Manager. #Knox Vault Storage The Knox Vault Storage is a dedicated, secure, non-volatile memory device that stores sensitive data such as the following: Cryptographic keys such as Blockchain keys and Device keys, Biometric data, Hashed authentication credentials Like the Knox Vault Processor, the Knox Vault Storage is designed to prevent various physical and side-channel attacks, using its own secure processor, SRAM, ROM, cryptographic module, and hardware monitor which detects physical tampering. ##Secure core The Secure Core is the Knox Vault Storage processor used to do the following: Execute the ROM code, Provide cryptographic operations for public key algorithms (RSA, ECC) and SHA algorithm with software libraries, Safely store data in dedicated SRAM and ROM ##Crypto engine The Crypto Engine supports symmetric encryption to verify authentication codes after receiving packets from the Knox Vault Processor and also to enhance performance. ##Hardware monitor As with the Hardware Monitor of the Knox Vault Subsystem, the Hardware Monitor of Knox Vault Storage also detects physical or side-channel attacks related to power, temperature, and electromagnetics. If the Hardware Monitor detects an attack, the Knox Vault Storage is automatically wiped. ##Non-volatile memory The Non-Volatile Memory is a bank of NOR (NOT OR) flash used to store data received from the Knox Vault Processor. #Knox Vault intercommunication The Knox Vault Subsystem and Knox Vault Storage communicate securely over a dedicated I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. All traffic on this bus is encrypted and transmitted with an authentication code. Additionally, all communications are protected against replay attacks. Protection from Attacks Knox Vault is tested to provide protection against the following classes of hardware probing attacks. #Physical probing An attacker might physically probe secure hardware to disclose user data or other critical information, while the data is stored in memory or being processed. The attacker directly measures information using electric contact with the secure hardware internals, using techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. #Physical manipulation An attacker might physically modify the secure hardware to change user data, secure hardware software, or security services or mechanisms. The attacker might make modifications through techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering. To make these modifications, the attacker identifies hardware security mechanisms, layout characteristics, or software design, including how secure hardware treats user data. Changes of circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary. #Forced information leakage An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware in order to disclose confidential user data, even if the information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker. For example, fault injection or physical manipulation might cause information leakage from signals which normally do not contain significant information about secrets. #Side-channel attack An attacker might exploit information that is leaked from the secure hardware during its operation in order to disclose confidential user data. Direct contact with the secure hardware internals is not required. Information leakage might occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics, clock frequency, or by changes in processing time. One example is the Differential Power Analysis (DPA). This leakage can be interpreted as a covert channel transmission, but is more closely related to the measurement of operating parameters. These operating parameters might be derived either from direct measurements or measurement of emanations. The attacker can associate the measurements with the specific operation being performed. #Fault injection An attacker might cause a malfunction of the secure hardware software by applying environmental stress like light or a power glitch. This attack type could modify the hardware and software functions, or deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the secure hardware. Thus, the attacker could disclose or manipulate the user data existing in the secure hardware. For example, the modification of the security hardware function might affect the quality of random numbers provided by the random number generator, and then the software may get constant values or value with low entropy. Common Criteria Certification Common Criteria is a framework for evaluating security products in a standardized way that is recognized by 31 countries globally through the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA). Knox Vault components are evaluated and certified by a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL), an independent third party. Depending on the processor configuration, Knox Vault is evaluated to the requirements specified in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages at EAL4+ or EAL5+ assurance requirements, a measure of the depth of the review performed on the product. These evaluations cover testing of a wide array of hardware attacks in addition to a review of the software/firmware of the Knox Vault Subsystem.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP). The Knox Platform's patented Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP) is the industry's strongest protection against kernel threats and exploits. RKP works seamlessly out-of-the-box, with no setup required. Simply powering on a Samsung Knox device provides world-class threat protection and attack mitigation. RKP supports the rest of the Knox security offerings to provide full security coverage without the typical gaps anticipated with mobile devices. Why does kernel protection matter? Kernel protection is central to device security and enterprise data protection. When attackers find software vulnerabilities, they often escalate privileges and compromise the core of the OS: the kernel. A compromised kernel can leak sensitive data and even allow remote monitoring and control of the affected device. Other more commonplace protections like Secure Boot or hardware-backed keystores are of little value if the kernel itself is controlled at runtime. After a device boots and decrypts sensitive content, a kernel compromise can result in data leaks that directly impact an enterprise's data integrity. RKP design and structure As part of the Knox Platform's security offerings, RKP employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Depending on the device model, either a dedicated hypervisor or the hardware-backed secure world provided by ARM TrustZone technology provides the isolated execution environment. RKP's isolation from the kernel shrinks the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and helps secure it from attacks designed to compromise the kernel. This unique ability enables RKP to detect and prevent the most common kernel attacks. RKP protections are grouped into three areas: Kernel code - RKP\"prevents modification of kernel code and logic. Kernel data - RKP\"prevents modification of critical kernel data structures. Kernel control flow - RKP\"prevents Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks that reuse existing kernel logic to piece together exploits from the kernel's own code. How is kernel protection possible? A kernel protection mechanism can't exist completely in the kernel only, since an attacker could circumvent it if the kernel itself has a flaw. The kernel is the lowest granular control level over the OS and, as such, usually can't be effectively monitored from any lower level in the system. RKP uniquely employs a security monitor within an isolated execution environment. Running within an isolated execution environment would normally compromise a security mechanism's ability to see into the kernel and monitor activities at runtime. However, RKP succeeds by utilizing patented techniques to control device memory management and by intercepting and inspecting critical kernel actions before allowing them to execute. RKP is thus able to prevent a compromised kernel from bypassing other security protections. This prevention significantly reduces the severity of kernel attacks and limits the effectiveness of exploits that would typically cripple a mobile device. Since RKP is always active and requires no management control, kernel protection is only possible if it meets strict usability and performance requirements. RKP's protections are activated out-of-the-box, with no performance impact to customers. #Periodic Kernel Measurement (PKM) The _TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture_ (TIMA) architecture provides a number of core features to protect against mobile device compromise. One of these central TIMA features is _Periodic Kernel Measurement_ (PKM). PKM periodically monitors the kernel to detect if legitimate kernel code and data were modified maliciously. PKM also monitors the key SE for Android data structures in OS kernel memory to prevent malicious attacks from corrupting and potentially disabling SE for Android. PKM\"protects the Linux kernel code and data pages from malicious exploits and helps prevent attacks attempting to disable SE for Android. During a device firmware build, the SHA1 hash of every kernel code, and read-only data page, is calculated and gathered into a measurement file. These measurements are signed by Samsung to ensure data integrity and authenticity before its included in the firmware. When TIMA is initialized, PKM receives the kernel page measurements and verifies the signature to prove integrity and authenticity before storing the measurements in the secure world. During device operation, TIMA periodically recalculates the measurements of the running kernel and compares them to the signed measurements stored on the device. If any discrepancy is detected, a violation is reported to both system logs and the user. When PKM runs, it reads the physical memory addresses used by SE for Android to determine whether: \u2022 SE for Android is enabled \u2022 SE for Android is in enforcing mode. If malicious code manages to disable SE for Android, or switch it to permissive mode, PKM detects the state change and reports a violation to quickly assist an administrator in problem diagnoses. Full security coverage Each year, Samsung's research and development teams add the latest runtime protections to a growing list of unique capabilities found only within RKP. At a 2018 mobile security conference, RKP was touted as the best Android protection technology available and was credited with the lack of new public exploits in the past year for Samsung Knox devices. Although RKP is only one piece of Samsung's holistic security solution, it successfully demonstrates the unique security guarantees possible when combining hardware, software, and advanced security research. Ensuring security claims are low maintenance, highly effective, and industry-leading is what provides enterprise customers the trust they need to deploy mobile devices in high-security environments.",

            "last_updated": "2023-07-26",
            "content": "Root of Trust. Imagine every device on your network simultaneously infected with malware and combing through your confidential data. Attacks and exploits continue to mature in sophistication in an attempt to stay ahead of advancing mobile device safeguards. So what's the single solution that works on all devices at the same time? Building a robust Root of Trust stack that minimizes exposure, detects intrusions, and locks down sensitive information. A Root of Trust is the cornerstone of any modern security protocol. It is a series of stringent checks and balances, beginning at the hardware level rather than the software level. This feature adds a level of security to devices, making them difficult to attack since hardware is less mutable than software. A Root of Trust answers many complicated security questions, such as: How do you know if a compromised OS was booted at runtime?, Can you trust that your certificates are stored securely?, Has an exploit modified the kernel or other system software? Samsung's approach to addressing this issue is to bottleneck all security-critical functionality through trustworthy components. These trustworthy components are thoroughly designed, reviewed, and maintained with the following considerations: What are the assurances required? High-security enterprise partners require near-total ability to control and audit the software interfacing with their systems. Device users must have the authority to deny permission to use their device features and data. Each user, partner, and integrated system has its own requirements, many of which are assured in large part through the Roots of Trust. How can components contribute to more complex assurances? A Trusted Boot process enables the trustworthy transfer of control from the bootloader to the Android framework. This trustworthy transfer of control plays a key role in the IT admin's ability to audit apps running on the device. Secure boot is a complex process built on top of many smaller components that validate software, configuration files, deployment processes, and update processes. Each of these smaller components contributes to the secure boot process, and a secure boot process itself contributes to the security of other processes. How can we make these components, their assurances, and their usage more robust? Each Trusted Application on a Samsung Knox device ultimately represents each Root of Trust. These Trusted Applications encompass functionality such as device identity, key management, and remote attestation of device health. Samsung Knox uses these same Trusted Applications to provide its own assurances. Knox Platform trusted environment The Knox Platform builds a unique, industry-leading trusted environment in four ways: Establishes a hardware-backed Root of Trust, on which other components rely. Builds trust during boot, through features like Trusted Boot. Maintains trust while the device is in use, through features like Real-Time Kernel Protection. Proves its trustworthiness on demand, through Device Health Attestation. This process and its components are as follows: How the Root of Trust works 1. Knox Platform security starts in the factory - before users even power on their device - when a Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) is generated on the device using its hardware random number generator. 2. Next, the DUHK generates and encrypts the Device Root Key (DRK) and Samsung Attestation Key (SAK). 3. Upon device start up, Samsung uses the Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK)\"to check all software components. One of the components is the TrustZone Secure world, a chip partition reserved for secure code and data. Only specially privileged software modules running within the TrustZone Secure world can access these keys. 4. The software performs a check on each Knox Platform feature before allowing it to run. Since this chain of security checks begins with the very first hardware check, each feature is protected by hardware Root of Trust. No matter which link in the chain an attacker targets, one of the security checks detects it. Secure hardware The Knox Platform trusted environment leverages the following hardware components. Bootloader ROM - The Primary Bootloader (PBL) is the first piece of code to run during the boot process. The PBL is trusted to measure and verify the boot chain. To prevent tampering, the PBL is kept in the ROM\"of the secure hardware. The device hardware loads and runs the PBL from ROM at boot, and the PBL starts the Secure and Trusted Boot processes. ARM TrustZone Secure world - The Secure world is the environment in which highly sensitive software runs. The ARM TrustZone hardware ensures memory and components marked secure (for example, a fingerprint reader)\"can only be accessed in the Secure World. Most of the system, including the kernel, middleware, and apps, run in the Normal World. The Secure world software, on the other hand, is more privileged, and can access both Secure and Normal world resources. Knox Vault - The Knox Vault is an independent, tamper-proof, secure subsystem with its own processor, memory, and an interface to dedicated non-volatile storage. The Knox Vault stores sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and authentication data. Even if the main application processor that runs Android is compromised, the Knox Vault protects secrets and guards against hardware attacks such as probing and fault injection. Hardware keys , Device-Unique Hardware Key (DUHK) - Samsung incorporates the DUHK, a device-unique symmetric key, in the device hardware during the initial manufacturing of the device. The DUHK binds data - for example, device health attestation data - to a particular device and is accessible only by a hardware cryptography module and not directly exposed to any device software. However, software can request that the DUHK encrypt and decrypt data. This DUHK\"encrypted data is bound to the device, and thus can't be decrypted on any other device. Device Root Key (DRK) - The DRK is a device-unique, asymmetric RSA key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key through an X.509 certificate. This certificate proves that Samsung produced the DRK. The DRK is generated at manufacture in the Samsung factory and is stored on the device encrypted by the DUHK, thus binding it to the device. The DRK is only accessible from within the TrustZone Secure world and is protected by the DUHK. The DRK is an important part of the Root of Trust, as it derives other signing keys. Because the DRK is device-unique, it can tie data to a device through cryptographic signatures. Signing keys are derived from the DRK and used to sign data. Samsung Secure Boot Key (SSBK) - The SSBK is an asymmetric key pair used to sign Samsung-approved boot executables. The private part of the SSBK is used by Samsung to sign secondary and app bootloaders. The public part of the SSBK is stored in the hardware's one-time programmable fuses at manufacture in the Samsung factory. The Secure Boot process uses this public key to verify whether each boot component it loads is approved. Samsung Attestation Key (SAK) - The SAK\"is also a device-unique, asymmetric key pair that is signed by Samsung's root key. This signed key pair proves that the SAK was produced by Samsung. The SAK\"is used to sign the Attestation blob that indicates if the device is in a trusted state. The signature proves that Attestation data originated from the TrustZone Secure world on a Samsung device. Unlike the DRK, the SAK is a set of ECDSA keys. ECDSA is a newer asymmetric algorithm, similar to RSA\"but smaller and faster for the same strength. Hardware fuses Samsung Knox security is built in layers, from low-level capabilities in the hardware to Android itself. One of the important low-level features are the hardware fuses, which provide a Root of Trust based in hardware. Samsung Root of Trust components are designed as one-time fuses, making a permanent record of data such as encryption keys, Rollback Prevention, and the Knox Warranty. #Rollback Prevention (RP) Fuses These fuses encode the minimum acceptable version of Samsung-approved bootloaders. Old software may contain known vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Rollback prevention excludes approved, but out-of-date bootloaders from being loaded. The RP fuse version number is set when system software is initially installed and when specific updates occur. Once the RP fuse version number is set, it is impossible to revert back to legacy software versions. #Knox Warranty Fuse The purpose of the Knox Warranty Fuse is to provide a record of the integrity of the device. Samsung monitors the integrity of several different components, detecting if any particular component is in a non-approved configuration. For example, the Trusted Boot process sets the fuse when it detects the following: an unsigned kernel is loaded, a critical security feature like SELinux is disabled These types of checks are critical as non-approved components could lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or access to normally protected peripherals. Such non-approved components can even lead to vulnerabilities being persistent over reboots or even future updates, for example, returning to an approved component. The Knox Warranty Fuse is designed to provide a tamper-resistant, persistent record of running in a non-approved state. Since the fuse can only be set one time, once it has been set to mark a non-approved configuration, the device is permanently marked as having had a non-approved configuration, regardless of any future actions. For the enterprise, this ensures that a previously compromised device cannot be brought back into a seemingly compliant state and used normally. To use the Knox Warranty Fuse, Samsung has integrated the measurement into several checks on the device, both during boot and after, allowing processes such as the following to see the status of the device: Access to the core encryption keys of TrustZone. The Knox Warranty Fuse value is used in the decryption of the Device-Unique Hardware Key and all data protected by this key. This blocks access to any keys stored in TrustZone, such as keys stored by enterprise apps. This means any data stored on the device becomes inaccessible after the Knox Warranty Fuse has been set. This includes data encrypted by DualDAR Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection. Device is factory reset after the Knox Warranty bit has been set. In this case, a user may be able to use the device, but Knox functions such as creating a work profile are blocked. Similarly, functions that rely on Knox security, such as Samsung Pay, are also blocked. The Device Health Attestation reports that the device has been compromised at some point, and reports this status to requesting services such as an Attestation Key. As a persistent record of the state of the device, the Knox Warranty Fuse is able to provide a unique capability to ensure that a Samsung device is trustworthy and has been maintained in a trustworthy state during its lifecycle.",

            "content": "Sensitive Data Protection (SDP). This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android's File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user's password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user's password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK.pri) with the SdpMasterKey, the same Key Encryption Key (KEK) used to encrypt the sensitive data per-file FEKs. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state. See also: File Based Encryption (FBE)\"and Full Disk Encryption (FDE). SDP protection of apps The native Samsung Email app automatically uses SDP to protect email bodies and attachments. For performance reasons, the email header (including the subject and sender) is not protected with SDP. The Knox Chamber is a dedicated directory in the Knox container file system. All stored files within the Knox Chamber directory are automatically marked as sensitive and are handled by the SDP mechanism. Unique advantages of Knox SDP , MDFPP-Compliant - Knox SDP is certified as MDFPP-compliant. Without Knox SDP, the base Android system is not certified as satisfying MDFPP requirements, which mandates a form of SDP. MDFPP compliance is a requirement for many government agencies and the companies they work with. Samsung has more MDFPP-certified products than any other mobility solution provider. Granular Control - You can use Knox SDP to protect not just the whole device, a container, or individual files but also selected database columns. Per-App Password - You can further customize Knox SDP to decrypt a particular app's Sensitive Data only after an app user enters an app-specific password. In this case, the device or container unlock authentication alone does not decrypt app data. An app password is also needed for a higher layer of security. App Protection - Knox SDP is enabled by default to secure both Samsung Email as well as Knox Chamber.",

Trusted Boot identifies and distinguishes unauthorized and out-of-date boot loaders before they compromise your mobile device. If unauthorized boot components happen to load, an enterprise can trust that only validated and current components are loaded after Trusted Boot segregates authorized from unauthorized boot loaders. Enterprises can check device integrity on demand through Knox Attestation, which reads Trusted Boot collected measurement data, along with an SE for Android enforcement setting, to form the basis of a device health verdict. Secure lockdown on tampering Bootloader measurements are recorded in secure TrustZone memory during device boot. At runtime, apps operating in the secure TrustZone can use these measurements to make security-critical decisions, such as whether or not to: Release cryptographic keys from the Knox Keystore. Launch the Work profile app container. If an unauthorized or out-of-date component version is detected, a tamper fuse is set. Once the fuse is set, sensitive work apps and data within the Work container are permanently encrypted and inaccessible since the integrity of the device is no longer guaranteed or validated. The device user can still boot the device and launch personal apps. This flexibility promotes a nice balance between consumer functions, such as smartphone calls and personal apps, and the requirement to protect enterprise data. Building on Secure Boot Before adopting Trusted Boot to work along with Secure Boot, Samsung devices were using Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading during start-up. Secure Boot is implemented by each bootloader cryptographically verifying the signature of the next bootloader in sequence, using a certificate chain with its root-of-trust resident in hardware. If verification fails at any step, the boot process terminates. While Secure Boot is effective at preventing unauthorized bootloaders, it is unable to distinguish between different authorized binary versions. For example, Secure Boot can't distinguish between a bootloader with a known vulnerability as opposed to a later patched version, since both versions have valid signatures. Trusted Boot however was introduced to verify the same bootloader, kernel and platform build. Knox Verified Boot (KVB) Knox Verified Boot (KVB) is a new solution that both extends and enhances Android Verified Boot (AVB). While AVB only checks the integrity of the kernel and platform components, KVB extends those checks to also cover the earlier bootloaders. This provides a more comprehensive guarantee the device is booting using properly signed components that are all from the same build. KVB performs the same type of validations as the existing Trusted Boot mechanism, but it is able to do so before the device kernel is booted, and thus provides the same data protection guarantees earlier. With KVB, component checks are conducted in the bootloader, and validations are made before system services are even started. KVB is supported on Samsung S10 and above devices running the Android P operating system or late",

But IT admins must understand and validate software changes prior to mass deployment. Samsung released the mobile industry's first firmware update management system on Android to enable IT to test and validate software updates and to control roll-out scope and timing. Why manage device software updates? In enterprises with fragmented platforms and firmware versions, mobile device deployment and support becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. Proprietary enterprise apps and application services behave inconsistently on different firmware versions, so features require testing and troubleshooting on a widening array of device platforms. Controlling the rollout of software updates allows IT admins to: Homogenize the firmware versions and capabilities of deployed device models. Carry out interoperability or compatibility testing with in-house or proprietary servers, apps, and endpoint settings. Ensure that known issues are patched before deployment of major firmware version updates. Perform field tests of new firmware and software on a subset of devices before mass deployment. Force the use of firmware versions that have been validated to meet industry certification or regulation requirements. Strict control over device firmware updates Samsung developed Enterprise Firmware Over-the-Air (E-FOTA) to enable enterprises to save time and support costs, and manage the mobile infrastructure as efficiently as possible. With E-FOTA, enterprises can control device software updates as follows: Select the highest firmware version allowed on devices - This option ensures that device users can't independently update to an unsupported firmware version, preventing issues that could negatively impact employee productivity, support costs, and data security. Force the download of a specific firmware version onto select devices - Enterprises can download new firmware to a few test devices to run interoperability or compatibility tests. This mandatory download is done with proprietary systems and apps to find any corner cases that might result in operational or performance issues. Mass deploy a new firmware version - Mass deployment prevents software version fragmentation so IT teams don't need to support multiple legacy firmware versions for each deployed device model. Schedule updates during non-peak work times - This option ensures updates don't interfere with employee productivity. Knox control over user updates A wide range of EMM partners support Samsung's firmware management features, integrating firmware management with other asset management activities. IT admins can use these tools to test and deploy software updates in a consistent and low-risk way. Through EMM\"solutions, enterprises can restrict users from loading unauthorized firmware, through their devices or USB-connected computers. Through the Knox Platform, enterprises can: Disable automatic firmware updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable automatic firmware updates. Disable all OTA updates - IT\"admins can prevent users from going to their Android Settings to enable or disable software updates in general.

With the Samsung Knox Platform, you can: Restrict and redirect Internet access to specific IP addresses and domains, Set firewall policies on a per-app or device basis, Produce logs reporting the blocked domains that users accessed Granular control of Internet access You can limit the permissible network connections to only trusted addresses, by setting the appropriate Internet access restrictions. The Knox Platform offers a variety of restriction methods, all of which can be used together: IP address filters - Allow, deny, and redirect access to specific IP addresses. Configure a filter to apply to transmitted data, received data, or both. Allow or deny both IPv4 and IPv6 formatted addresses. Domain name filters - Allow or deny access to an entire domain or sub-domain. Per-app and device-wide modes - Give specific apps - for example, ones that handle confidential data - stronger firewalls, and all other apps on a device a more lenient firewall configuration. Log unsafe URL access The Knox Platform provides visibility into denied attempts to access blocked domains. The improved visibility helps you to remain aware of potential security breaches or insecure browsing practices within your organization. The Knox Platform logs reports with the following information: App name - The package name of the app attempting to access a blocked domain. Blocked domain URL - The URL of the domain name blocked by your firewall. Timestamp - The time the incident occurred, to assist with troubleshooting incidents.",

            "content": "Granular Device Management. The Knox Platform's granular device management features are specifically curated, from partner feedback and industry data, to solve some of the most common frustrations enterprises face when mass deploying devices. These unique policies provide device flexibility and customization beyond any other device provider. The policies help organizations manage operations more effectively, secure confidential assets, and reduce administrative overhead. They also solve particular issues regarding industry regulation and compliance. Custom boot banner Samsung Knox is the only mobile platform that allows an enterprise to natively change the device boot logo. In many industries, such as government or defense, this change is mandatory for compliance. Through the Knox Platform, enterprise IT\"admins and developers can customize the following: Samsung boot up display, Splash screen animation, when the device is turned on or off, Lockscreen image, which can provide an enterprise logo or contact info for lost phones Enterprises can use these capabilities to mitigate problems such as the following: Phone is lost and found - Owner information is available by simply powering on the device. There is no need to attempt to unlock the device or call the carrier. The device can be returned to the enterprise quickly. Multiple phones - Displaying an enterprise logo on bootup lets users know that the device belongs to and is secured by the enterprise. This logo clearly distinguishes it from other devices in the user's possession. Split billing (Dual APN) Split billing separates enterprise and personal data usage. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) deployments, enterprise billing allows employees to be properly compensated for data costs generated from work-related app usage. In Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) deployments, enterprise billing allows employers to pay for data usage incurred only for work purposes. Split billing also works with dual SIM devices, by mapping some apps to using the data plan from one SIM, and other apps to the other SIM's data plan. Remote admin lock of device This feature allows an IT\"admin to remotely lock out a device, for example, when the device is out of compliance.\"Once the device is locked, only an IT admin can unlock it and not a device user. This functionality solves two problems: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device if it gets lost or stolen. Prevents users with valid login credentials from using the device, for example, if the credentials are stolen or the user is no longer allowed to use the device. With stock Android, an IT admin can lock a device only if it is currently unlocked. If the device is already locked, an admin can't lock it to prevent future unauthorized logins. Enterprise roaming Roaming mobile connections can incur unexpected data costs. Multiplied across an enterprise's mobile workforce, these costs can become exorbitant. Rather than just simply disabling all mobile roaming, the Knox Platform provides more granular controls for enterprises, letting them control which mission-critical apps are allowed to use data during mobile roaming. Enterprises could enable roaming data for: All apps in the Work container, A single app within the Work container, A single app in the personal space They can also set up Split Billing, with separate roaming policies for the APNs\"set up for personal and enterprise billing. Granular policies #Call restrictions Enterprises can apply granular settings to the caller app, allowing only: Emergency calling, Calling to certain numbers, A limited number of calls per day #SMS management Knox provides many advanced SMS policies. Policies frequently used by organizations include: Adding an automatic company disclaimer to the bottom of every outgoing text, Restricting the number of texts per day, Auditing and recording all incoming and outgoing SMS messages #SD card restrictions Most vendors don't provide sophisticated options to manage an SD\"card.\"Typically, enterprises must choose between one of two options: allow full read and write access to the SD\"card or completely block it. The Knox Platform addresses this industry pain point by giving enterprises independent control over read and write access. Knox can: Allow read access but block write access, Allow write access but block read access This level of control means you can provide one-way data access to sensitive data to effectively meet your security requirements. #Bluetooth restrictions To mitigate attacks perpetrated through Bluetooth connections, Knox provides these controls: Completely disable Bluetooth - Turn off Bluetooth and Bluetooth background scanning. Block specific Bluetooth profile types - Restrict the types of Bluetooth devices that the user can connect to the device, for example: Allow Bluetooth headphones , Block Bluetooth file transfers, which could leak private data #USB class restrictions Knox can restrict or allow different types of USB-connected devices, more specifically, the USB\"device classes defined through usb.org. This feature includes access to the following USB\"device classes: Audio, Video, Audio/Video, Mass Storage, Content Security, Smart Card, Printe, Hub, Type-C Bridge, Wireless Controlle, Human Interface Device (HID), Communications, CDC\"Control, CDC\"Data, Personal Healthcare, Billboard, Diagnostic For example, you could block all USB devices except Smart Card readers. #Keyboard Input Methods (IME) The Keyboard Input Method (IME) framework has received a major security upgrade with Knox 3.2.1. In Knox 3.2.1, the personal and Work container keyboards are completely separate to ensure that important work data is not compromised. In an Android Enterprise Work Profile, the same IME is used for both the personal and profile side. An shared IME may potentially leak sensitive data through an exploit buried in the IME. For example, let's say a device user downloads a malicious IME\"from Google Play for use on the personal side. Android Enterprise - This IME is shared with the Work profile and sensitive data may leak. Samsung\"Knox - The IME is isolated from the Work container and can't access sensitive information. In previous versions of Knox, IT admins were required to add 3rd party IMEs to an allowlist for added security. Now that personal and Work container IMEs are kept separate, users are able to use third party keyboards without prior explicit allowance from IT admins.",

Not only can IT admins have real-time access to what the remote device screen is displaying, but also control it by injecting actions such as finger, keyboard, and mouse events. Although other mobile platforms also offer remote viewing of remote device displays, only Knox provides built-in remote control of devices without requiring third-party solutions. Here is an example use case: An enterprise employee is on a business trip. On encountering a problem with the company-issued mobile phone, the employee contacts an enterprise IT\"admin. The IT\"admin uses an EMM console to remotely view the device screen to observe the issue first hand, then remotely controls the device, through finger, mouse, or keyboard actions. The IT\"admin directly accesses the environment to remotely debug the issue on the device.\"The employee is now quickly productive, without the frustrating downtime associated with relaying instructions verbally or through email. The continuous polling of the device screens doesn't impact device performance as devices send only screen changes. Unique advantages of Knox Remote Control The Knox Platform provides built-in remote control without requiring third-party solutions. For enterprises, this control: Saves time by enabling IT admins to troubleshoot remote mobile device issues in real-time.

            "content": "Network Platform Analytics (NPA). Endpoint devices, such as mobile devices, are hard to monitor for security issues. Third-party apps can't inspect OS behaviors and networking patterns, something that is possible on desktop platforms. These limitations, combined with the prevalent use of endpoint encryption create an information \"black hole\". This information black hole makes it more difficult to detect misconfigurations, troubling network usage patterns, the misuse of enterprise resources, or other signs of issues that impact an enterprise's bottom line. The NPA framework enables insights into mobile software and network use, misconfiguration, and network-based threats. Powerful analytics solutions use the NPA\"framework to increase endpoint visibility without violating the confidentiality of data moving across enterprise devices and networks. Combined with a compatible analytics solution, NPA simplifies many device administration tasks: Detect more IT problems - \"I don't know what I can't see!\", Detect problems faster - \"Notify me automatically of suspicious patterns.\", Investigate more easily - \"Walk me through the chain of events.\", See root cause attribution - \"Am I being attacked? Is this a bug? Is something misconfigured?\", Provide visibility required to trust mobile devices - \"Show me how my network is being used.\", Enable quicker remediation - \"Lock down the device, user, or app causing this issue!\" NPA design The NPA framework provides real-time information about the network packets leaving a device and the context surrounding the flow of data. An NPA-compatible Network Analyzer then analyzes the available data to provide valuable insights. Is your new beta app sending sensitive data to an unexpected server in a foreign country? Analyzing endpoint flow data gives us insights into network traffic, such as: The destination of every network flow, using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, The domain name originator associated with the destination IP address, The start and stop time for the network flow, The number of bytes transferred in and out during the network session, The name of the process or app initiating the data flow, The cryptographic signature of the app initiating the data flow, and of its parent process, Whether or not traffic originated from a tethered device (for example, a mobile hotspot) or from within the device NPA maintains enterprise data confidentiality as it only inspects the header data and the context surrounding network traffic patterns. NPA and NPA-compatible network analyzers don't have access to actual data packets. This feature is a strong differentiator compared to solutions that unnecessarily collect and redirect all endpoint network traffic, usually by means of a web proxy or VPN. Unique advantages of Knox NPA The Knox platform NPA\"provides the only mobile platform for granular endpoint networking insights. Some unique advantages are: NPA\"is unaffected by endpoint network encryption. NPA\"can uniquely attribute network patterns to the specific software responsible. NPA\"can differentiate between traffic originating from a well-known Android app and a fake app impersonating the app. NPA\"does not expose your entire network traffic to the analytics solution. NPA-compatible solutions Samsung's release partner for NPA is Cisco. Cisco's network security products can now interface with Knox NPA to provide endpoint visibility of Knox devices. Admins can get this visibility even when a VPN is encrypting endpoint traffic. These insights are exposed to admins using the Cisco StealthWatch console and remediation steps performed using Cisco ICE. Other Knox partners are preparing NPA-based solutions to help solve other common problems associated with mobile device deployments.",

            "content": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Standard Android comes with basic VPN abilities that are adequate for most consumers. But many enterprises need better security and more flexible VPN controls for larger deployments. The Knox VPN framework includes the most advanced enterprise-focused feature set, which ensures that VPN connections are efficient, reliable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The Knox Platform VPN framework allows the integration of third-party VPN clients in addition to the built-in VPN client. Unique advantages of Knox VPN framework The Knox Platform VPN framework supports all common VPN types, protocols, and configuration options. When deploying VPN solutions, enterprise IT admins must ensure VPN deployments work smoothly, don't waste server resources, limit the VPN solution licensing costs, and enforce strict security policies that prevent data leakage. The following is an example showing how Knox on-demand VPNs save cost: The Knox Platform provides the following differentiating VPN features and advantages: The flexibility to use a VPN tunnel for the entire device (work profile as well as fully managed device) or a single app only. The cost saving benefit of using VPN tunnels on-demand, only when apps in a VPN profile are running. The convenience to bypass VPN tunnels when a device is on-premise in a local corporate network. The strict coverage of corner cases to prevent data leakage outside of VPN tunnels, even during a device boot. The ability to connect multiple tunnels simultaneously. The extra security of chaining VPNs (also known as cascading or nesting VPNs) for greater anonymity, for example, in classified deployments. The power of configuring web proxies over VPN: Web proxy configurations are tunnel-specific. Web proxy support for NTLM authentication, basic authentication, PAC, and PAC with authentication. The ability to configure SSL/IPSEC VPN profiles on multiple devices. The advantage of extending VPN tunnels from a mobile device to a tethered laptop, in situations where a laptop does not have network connectivity. The following Knox VPN features are also available, but are dependent on the VPN client: QoS or traffic tracking and shaping. The Knox VPN framework can inform the VPN client when any installed apps generate any traffic. Automatic reconnection of VPN tunnels when the server side disconnects. Server-side disconnections are more difficult to detect and handle than device-side disconnections, which are usually related to detectable conditions like loss of connectivity or the presence of new network connections, such as a new Wi-Fi connection. Robust handling of enterprise requirements Regardless of the features you choose, the VPN should act predictably even when the unexpected occurs. The following are some common scenarios where Knox Platform enhancements ensure proper VPN behavior: VPN tunnels handle system events such as power saving mode entry or exit, package addition or removal, connectivity changes, and admin app changes. VPN profiles can specify which non-present apps must (not) use a VPN tunnel if they are ever installed. Even the free, built-in VPN client supports all the advanced VPN features listed in the previous list items. Robust blocking rules prevent data from leaking to the outside of the tunnel. Common gaps in coverage that Knox Platform VPNs correctly handle include: A VPN client crash or other client app issues , A tunnel that has not yet been established, for example, during boot , A VPN client that is unable to connect to a VPN serve , A proxy port that is blocking, Handle captive portal prior to VPN tunnel establishment. High-security built-in VPN client The built-in Android VPN client (also called Android VPN Management for Knox) is available on all Samsung devices, and is also integrated with the Knox Platform VPN framework, enabling the extra properties available within the Knox platform. The built-in VPN client, even without the Knox VPN framework, is differentiated from what Android offers, providing these advanced VPN features: FIPS 140-2 certified device cryptography components, CPA certification at the Foundation grade, based on its successful Common Criteria evaluation against the Protection Profile for IPsec VPN Clients v1.4, Security characteristics of IPSec VPN client version 2.5, as set by the NCSC, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2) and Suite-B algorithms: IPsec IETF RFCs - IKEv1 , IKEv1 - Main and aggressive IKE exchange modes with pre-shared key, certificates, Hybrid RSA, and EAP-MD5 authentications , IKEv2 with PSK and certificate-based authentication , IKEv2 - Pre-shared key, certificates, EAP-MD5 EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication methods, and mobile extensions , IKEv1 Suite B Cryptography supported with PSK and ECDS signature-based authentications , IKEv2 Suite B Cryptography supported with ECDSA signatures",

            "content": "Biometric Authentication. Traditional user authentication relies on things you know or have, like a password or ID\"card. These are susceptible to human mistakes, phishing, and duplication. Biometric authentication validates a personal trait, for example: fingerprints, irises, or facial features. Biometrics can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR). Users can use biometrics to unlock devices and app containers. Through Samsung Pass, users can also use biometrics to log into apps and websites. Unique advantages of Knox Biometrics The Knox Platform provides the following in addition to standard Android capabilities: Secure storage - On Samsung devices, the authentication software doesn't share or distribute the biometric measurements of any user. The measurements are stored in a format that can't be used to reproduce the original biometric, and can only be accessed and decoded within the specific part of the TrustZone that has access to the biometric hardware. Biometrics are used only on the correct device and by the correct user. This functionality means there is a lower chance of someone spoofing biometrics credentials to access a device. Enforced two-factor authentication (2FA) - The Knox Platform provides IT admins the option to enforce two-factor authentication with biometrics for the Work container. For example, a user can be required to authenticate with an iris scan in addition to a standard device unlock method (password, PIN, pattern). While Android provides some combinations of two-factor authentication, the Knox Platform allows you to take your security one step further with biometric integration. Samsung Pass integration - Apps can use Samsung Pass APIs to enforce biometric authentication in place of a traditional login and password. This authentication method can save an organization a large amount of password management overhead, while further increasing device security. Samsung Pass features the ability to: - Support Fast IDentification Online (FIDO) authentication , Register and deregister a user's biometrics , Respond to remote wipe requests , Manage authentication transactions , Work in the Secure World of the TrustZone , Enterprise credentials override - As required by enterprise policy, Knox devices allow you to enforce the use of enterprise AD\"credentials to unlock a device or Work container. This setting overrides any biometrics set by the user, and forces them to use their enterprise credentials.",

In this section, we'll cover how to: Get access to the portal, Select your Knox services, Navigate the dashboard, Get started using the portal Get access to the portal Before you can start using the Knox Admin Portal, you first need to sign up for a Samsung Knox account, which requires a Samsung account. If you don't already have a Samsung account, you'll be able to create one later. To sign up for a Samsung Knox account: 1. Go to SamsungKnox.com. 2. In the top-right corner, click Enroll. 3. Under Work email, enter the email address you use for work. 4. If you already have a Samsung account associated with your work email, you're asked to sign in to your Samsung account. If you don't have a Samsung account yet, you're taken to the Samsung account sign up page to create one. Follow the account creation steps as directed. 5. After you successfully verify your Samsung account with the PIN sent to your email, you're redirected back to the Samsung Knox portal to complete your registration. Check that the details shown are correct, then click NEXT. 6. Fill in your company information, then click NEXT. 7. Review the Samsung Knox agreements, select the applicable boxes, then click SUBMIT. Your application is then submitted to the Samsung Knox team for approval, which may take a few days. You'll receive an email once you're approved. When you sign in after approval, you're then automatically taken to the Knox Admin Portal. Select your Knox services When you first sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, you're greeted with a welcome screen that guides you through the steps to set up the portal. Then, you're prompted to select the Knox services you want to use. The services you select define which consoles you see in the portal. Some services are already selected based on the services you were approved for, but you can always show or hide services later. Depending on the additional services you select, you might need to acknowledge some terms and conditions or privacy policies to continue. Once you confirm your selection, the Knox Admin Portal shows the services you chose in the navigation pane. You can now seamlessly access Knox service features. You'll only receive system emails for the services you selected. Navigate the dashboard By default, you'll see a dashboard upon sign-in to the Knox Admin Portal.

If you set the landing page to be a service-specific dashboard, you won't immediately see the Knox Admin Portal dashboard when you sign in anymore. See Customize the portal to learn more.

            "content": "Manage admins and roles for Knox services. To streamline the admin management process, the Knox Admin Portal offers a consolidated Administrators & Roles page that allows you to invite and manage admins for multiple services. In the left sidebar of the Knox Admin Portal, click Administrators & Roles to view a list of admins for all supported Knox services. Only admins with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can access the consolidated Administrators & Roles page. Administrators The Administrators tab displays a list of all admins registered for Knox services. The list contains the following information: NAME - The name of the admin. The super admin, who created the enterprise's tenant, is marked with a crown next to their name. Click an admin's name to view or edit their details, including services they have access to and roles they have been assigned. EMAIL - The work email address of the admin. Additionally, all currently supported Knox services are included as columns in the list. If an admin has permission to manage a service, their role and admin status is shown in the service column. In order to view the admin list for a service, a user must have a role with the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. An admin with either the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission can grant another admin any available permission, regardless of whether the granting admin has that permission or not. #Invite an admin Click INVITE ADMINISTRATOR to add a new admin. An Invite administrator page opens, where you're prompted to enter the first name, last name, email address, and service permissions for the new admin. Similar to other Knox services, you can also bulk invite admins by uploading a CSV file containing their first names, last names, and email addresses. If an admin has not yet been invited to all available services, click INVITE TO MORE SERVICES to select services and roles for that admin. #Edit an admin This feature is only available if your admin user has the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission. Once you've invited an admin, click their name in the admin list to edit their details. On the Edit administrator page, you can modify the admin's first and last names, as well as their roles for each service they're invited to. Use the Knox Manage console to add super admins and edit other admin types. #Deactivate an admin If you want to prevent an admin from managing certain Knox services your company uses, you can choose to deactivate their account. Only active admins can be deactivated. To deactivate a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to deactivate. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Deactivate account. 3. Select the Knox services you don't want the admin to manage anymore, then click DEACTIVATE. The admin then won't be able to access the Knox services you selected, but can still manage any services you unselected. #Delete an admin If an admin no longer needs to manage any Knox services for your company, you can delete them from your admin list. Make sure you have the Invite and manage administrators or Manage roles permission for the same Knox services as the admin you're deleting, or the Delete account option is disabled. If you delete an admin with permission to manage Knox Guard from the Knox Admin Portal, they can still access the Knox Guard console afterward. Note that they also need to be deleted from the Knox Guard console to ensure their access to Knox cloud services is fully revoked. To do so, submit a support ticket. To delete a Knox admin: 1. In Administrators & Roles, click the name of the admin you want to delete. 2. Click MORE ACTIONS, then Delete account. 3. (Optional) Enter a reason for the admin deletion. 4. Click DELETE. The admin is then deleted from your company's account and can no longer access your Knox services and data. Note that this action also deletes their Samsung Knox account. Roles On the ROLES tab, you can define custom permissions for admins for each solution, or for all solutions. Above the list, the search bar lets you search for roles by name. The roles list contains the following information: SERVICE - The Knox service, or services, the role applies to. ROLE NAME - Either Super admin or the name of a custom role, both of which you can click on. Depending on whether you click a super admin role or a custom role, the resulting pop-up shows: Super admin - The role details, along with a dropdown that lets you switch between services to view the permissions for each. The first admin who created the account is marked with a crown next to their name, and is also known as the account super admin. Custom role - The role details, its permissions, and the number of admins assigned to it. Custom roles for Knox Manage must be defined through the Knox Manage console instead. In the Knox Admin Portal roles list, custom Knox Manage roles are listed as Sub Admin. DESCRIPTION - A short phrase describing the organizational purpose of the role. ADMINISTRATORS - The number of admins assigned to the role. Click a number to see a full list of the admins and their information. #Create a role To create a custom role, click CREATE ROLE to the right of the search bar. On the Create role page, you can select a Knox service for the role and enter a name and description for it. Based on the service you're creating a role for, various permissions are available. When you're finished, click SAVE to complete the role creation. #Edit a role To edit an existing role, click its ROLE NAME. Similar to the Create role page, you can enter a new role name, description, and permissions for the service. However, you can't reassign the role to another service. Once you're finished editing, click SAVE to record your changes. Alternatively, you can choose to delete the role. Click DELETE at the bottom of the page to remove the role from the list and remove the associated permissions for all admins who are assigned to the role. Note that this action can't be undone.",

If your organization has devices enrolled in multiple Knox cloud services, the Knox Admin Portal offers a single, consolidated view that displays a device's details across all the services it's enrolled in. If you're a managed service provider admin, device and service info is limited to the customer you're currently managing. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, enter a device IMEI or serial number to view Knox service info for that device, shown as a centralized device info page. If the device you're searching for has two SIMs, you can enter either the primary or secondary IMEI to view its info. You can also navigate to this device view from the Device page in each individual service console by clicking View all device information. The centralized device info page displays the following: SERVICE - If the device is registered in a Knox cloud service and its user is invited to the service, the service name is shown. Click a service name to open the device's details on that service console and make updates to its info as required. Clicking a Knox Manage (KM) link opens that page on the KM console in a new browser tab. DEVICE STATUS - The last known enrollment status of the device, as reported by the service.

For Knox E-FOTA, info about the assigned campaign is shown instead. DEVICE INFO - Service-specific info about the device. For example, if the service is KM, the device's associated user ID, organization, and/or group are shown. SERVICE END DATE - The date when the service or license expires. LAST SEEN - The date when the device last connected to the Knox cloud server. LAST MODIFIED - The date when changes were last pushed to the device. Delete a device from all Knox cloud services Admins with device management permissions for and access to all Knox cloud services can delete a device from all services with one action, instead of deleting it from each individual service. If a device uploaded from an EMM is deleted, and its EMM group is synced with Knox E-FOTA after deletion, the device will be added to Knox E-FOTA again. To delete a device from all services: 1. In the search bar at the top of the Knox Admin Portal, search for a device by its IMEI or serial number. 2. On the centralized device info page, click !Menu icon, then Delete device.

If the deletion is successful, the device is deleted from all supported services in the Knox Admin Portal, including Knox Remote Support. If the deletion is only partially successful, you'll see a notification for each failed deletion with a downloadable CSV file containing more information.",

            "content": "Knox Admin Portal 21.09 release notes. Show/Hide Knox services Until now, IT admins could not control (that is, add or remove) services from within the unified Knox Admin Portal. This release introduces a new feature where IT admins can manually set show or hide settings for each of their services. The new process works as follows: 1. The user registers for KCS services using the unified Knox Admin Portal. 2. When the IT admin first logs in to the unified Knox Admin Portal, a Select Services page shows. The IT admin can select the appropriate service from this location. Once set up, the IT admin can choose to add or remove services using the User Profile or Avatar screen > Manage Services and Preferences > Show/Hide Service buttons. 3. After selecting the required services, the IT admin clicks Confirm. The IT admin must select at least one service without which they cannot proceed to the next step. 4. After confirmation, the device sync notification shows and the added services show on the left hand navigation menu. IT admins attached to accounts get notification emails from all selected services. The Primary Admin on the account can see all the services that are currently supported for their country. Secondary Admins, however, can see only these services if they are invited by a Primary Admin for their account. 5. Once the device information is synced, hiding the added services does not remove the devices' information from the database. If the IT admin were to add the service again, all information synced previously is still visible. If a device sync is not successful, contact Samsung Support to troubleshoot the issue. Consolidate notification emails across services Previously, when users signed up for multiple Knox services from the unified Knox Admin Portal, they received multiple notification emails. Going forward, notification emails for registration, approval, and rejection of requests from the unified Knox Admin Portal are sent in a single notification email. Going forward, users can only receive notification emails from services that are set to show on the left navigation pane. This change applies to all Knox services, namely: Knox Portal, Knox Configure, Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, Samsung Care+ for Business, Knox Asset Intelligence, and Knox Manage. Data Processing Agreement Users with direct access to the unified Knox Admin Portal can now agree to the Samsung Knox Data Processing Agreement (DPA) when they enroll for or log in to SamsungKnox.com services. The DPA covers the entire KCS solution as well as all components of the KPE. This DPA applies to customers (IT Admins) but not to MSP and Reseller users. Notify users of errors when special characters are used in Bulk invites When IT admins try to set up bulk invites using a CSV file for users in the unified Knox Admin Portal, first and last name fields cannot use the following 10 characters: \" / = + @ ( ) Until the previous release, when these characters were used for first or last name fields, the process failed without any notifications given to the IT admin. Going forward, whenever these special characters are used, the console notifies the IT admin through an error log. This improvement allows IT admins to correct these errors and ensure the bulk invite process is successful. Back to release notes",

Support for Samsung account login using Google SSO In this release, IT admins accessing the Knox Admin Portal through the direct console link can now sign in to their Samsung account using Google SSO. On the Samsung Account sign-in page, a Continue with Google button is available at the bottom of the screen. An IT admin can click this button to log in with their Google credentials and access the Knox Admin Portal. Okta SSO integration With 21.11, IT admins can set up Okta SSO to log in to SamsungKnox.com and the Knox Admin Portal. The three available SSO options are as follows: 1. Okta 2. Microsoft Azure AD 3. Ping Identity Please note that once Okta SSO is set up for a Knox cloud services tenant, its users can no longer log in to Knox services with their Samsung account credentials. See Configure Okta SSO settings for integration steps. Refreshed navigation sidebar The Knox Admin Portal navigation sidebar was refreshed for Knox cloud service 21.11.

This knowledge base article guides you through the steps on how to collect these logs. How do I collect dumpstate logs on a mobile device? The easiest way to get these logs from a Samsung mobile device is to use the SysDump tool: 1. Reproduce the issue that you would like to troubleshoot. Note that logs must be collected within 10 minutes of reproducing the issue. 2. Launch the Phone app. If your device does not have a Phone (for example, device is Wi-Fi only like the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition), use the Calculator app and enter `(+30012012732+` in the keypad. This switches the Calculator to Factory Mode. 3. Enter `*#9900#` to launch the SysDump tool. 4. Tap Run dumpstate/logcat 5. Tap Copy to sdcard. This copies a timestamped .log file to the folder `/log`, which you can access through My Files in your personal space. 6. Navigate to the log directory that was created on the device using the My Files app or a Windows PC with USB cable connection. 7. You can send the file to Knox Support using one of these methods: From My Files, share the .log file via email. Connect a USB cable to a computer, then copy the file to your computer, and email the file from your computer. Some carriers, like Verizon, have disabled the SysDump tool on their devices. For these devices, use the Android Debug Bridge instead. If requested by Knox Support, you may need to change the debug level to MID. To change the debug level, perform Steps 2 and 3 above, then tap Debug Level > MID. After the device restarts, follow Steps 1-7 above to collect the logs.

            "content": "About Secured by Knox, Android - Others and Android Go devices. Overview This knowledge base article clarifies the difference between Secured by Knox, Android, Others, and Android Go devices. Some Samsung devices are incompatible with certain Knox solutions. You can check which category your device falls under at Devices secured by Knox. All fully Knox-supported devices have the Android, Secured by Knox designation, while devices with limited or no Knox compatibility are marked as Android, Others or Android Go. What's the difference between a Secured by Knox device and an Android, Others/Android Go device? Secured by Knox devices include a hardware-backed architecture that ensures your data is protected during boot-up and runtime. On a hardware level, Android, Others and Android Go devices lack the Root of Trust keys in the Trusted Execution Environment (i.e. the \"TrustZone\"). While these devices typically cannot support Knox Platform for Enterprise, and by extension the other Knox solutions, special workarounds are implemented to support them in specific Knox cloud products. Which Knox solutions do Android, Others devices support? Supported Knox solutions and features: Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox Configure, Knox Manage without any Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox E-FOTA, Android Enterprise (Generic) Unsupported Knox solutions and features: Knox Platform for Enterprise, Knox Service Plugin, Knox Manage, Knox Platform for Enterprise or Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium policies, Knox Mobile Enrollment Direct, Knox Capture, Knox Asset Intelligence, Knox Deployment App Android, Others devices provide only basic security, manageability and customization, and are not ideal for enterprise deployments.

When adding a device in a second service (e.g. enrolling in Knox Mobile Enrollment after enrolling in Knox Configure), the following error message is shown: > The device is already enrolled. Cause This behavior is by design. After the KCS server looks for any profiles associated with the device, one of two actions occurs: If no profiles are found, the user is prompted to enroll with Bluetooth or NFC. If one or more profiles are\"found, KDA proceeds to the next step\"without prompting for Bluetooth or NFC enrollment. Bluetooth enrollment is only available when enrolling in a KCS service for the first time, and if the device was not previously enrolled in any other KCS service. If a profile is found, KCS checks if the device is already enrolled with the profile, then repeats for any additional profiles. For example, if the only profile assigned to the device is in Knox Mobile Enrollment (KME), KCS\"retrieves the KME profile and marks the device as enrolled. KDA then displays the message \"The device is already enrolled\". If no profile is found, KDA continues with the enrollment process.
